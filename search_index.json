に変換する．\nIRを意味表現に変換する（すなわち，それが何であるかだけでなく，何をするか）．\nバイナリを実際に解析する．これはたとえば：\nプログラムの部分または全体の静的解析（すなわち，依存解析，プログラムスライシング）．\nプログラムの状態空間に対するシンボリック探索（すなわち，「オーバーフローを見つけるまでプログラムを実行できるか？」）\n上記の組合せ（すなわち，「オーバーフローを見つけるために，メモリ書き込みに関するプログラムスライスだけを実行してみよう」）．\n\n\n\nangrはこれらの技術的課題に対応するコンポーネント群を擁しています．\n本書は，それぞれのコンポーネントがどのように動作し，どのようにあなたの悪だくみに貢献するか解説します．\nバイナリのロード\nangrのインストールが済めば，解析対象のバイナリをロードできるようになります．\nこのプロセス，そしてそれを提供するangrのコンポーネント（CLEと呼ばれます）はこちらで解説されています．\n中間表現\nangrは中間表現（具体的にはVEX）を用いて異なるアーキテクチャのバイナリを解析できるようにします．\nこのIRはこちらで解説されています．\nソルバエンジン\n制約充足問題の解決やその他の演算処理は，Claripyと呼ばれるangrのサブモジュールによって提供されています．\nほとんどのangrユーザーは，Claripyについて知る必要はありませんが，必要に備えてドキュメントが提供されています．\nClaripyの詳しい説明はこちら．\nプログラムの状態\nangrはエミュレートされたマシンの状態へのインターフェイスを提供しています．\nangrを正しく扱うためには，これを理解することが重要です．詳しい説明はこちら．\nプログラムのパス\nプログラムは，実行に沿うパス単位で解析することができます．\nangrは各パスが何を実行し，何をするか暴きます．\n本章では，angrのパス解析機能の利用法を紹介します．\n意味表現\nangrの強力な機能は，プログラムの状態に与える影響という観点で基本ブロックを表現する能力です．\nすなわち，angrは基本ブロックが何であるかばかりでなく，何をするか推論することができます．\nこちら.で解説されている，SimuVEXというモジュールがこれを成し遂げます．\nシンボリック実行\nangrは優れたシンボリック実行エンジンを提供します．\nこのエンジンへのインターフェイス，そしてその使い方はこちらで解説されています．\nプログラム全体の解析\n上記すべてのコンポーネントを団結させることで，angrは複雑な，プログラム全体にまたがった解析を簡単に進めることができます．\n解析のメカニズムと，そのためのスクリプトの書き方はこちらで解説されています．\n実例\n私たちはいくつかのangrの利用例を書きました！　こちらから読むことができます．\n"},"INSTALL.html":{"url":"INSTALL.html","title":"インストール","body":"angrのインストール\nangrはPythonのライブラリです．そのため，angrを使うためには，Python環境上にangrをインストールする必要があります．\nangrはPython 2用にビルドされています：Py3kサポートはいずれ実現可能ですが，私たちはいますぐその仕事に取り掛かることに躊躇しています（プルリクエストを歓迎します！）．\n私たちはangrのインストールと利用にpython virtual environmentを使うことを強く勧めます．\nいくつかのangr依存関係 (z3, pyvex) は，そのオリジナルからフォークされたネイティブコードのライブラリを必要とします．既にlibz3またはlibVEXをインストール済みなら，公式の共有ライブラリを上書きしたくないですよね．通例，virtualenv以外の環境へのangrのインストールから生じる問題のサポートを期待しないでください．\n依存関係\nPythonの依存関係はすべてpipまたはsetup.pyスクリプトで解決する必要があります．\nしかしながら，この作業では，Cソースコードをビルドする必要があるので，よいPython環境だけでなく，Python開発用ヘッダファイルが必要となるでしょう．\n依存関係のインストールプロセスの最中，Pythonライブラリcffiがインストールされますが，オペレーティングシステム公式のlibffiパッケージをインストールしない限り，（少なくともLinuxでは）それが実行されることはありません．\nUbuntuでは，次のコマンドがお望みに沿うでしょう：sudo apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev build-essential virtualenvwrapper\nほとんどのオペレーティングシステム，すべての*nixシステム\nangrはPython Package Indexで公開されているので，ほとんどの場合，mkvirtualenv angr &amp;&amp; pip install angrによってangrをインストールできるはずです．\nFish (shell) ユーザーはまた，virtualfishあるいはvirtualenvのパッケージを利用できます．\nvf new angr &amp;&amp; vf activate angr &amp;&amp; pip install angr\n失敗する場合，https://github.com/angr から順番に下記のリポジトリ（およびそのrequirements.txtに記載された依存関係）をインストールすることで，angrをインストールできます．\n\nclaripy\narchinfo\npyvex\ncle\nsimuvex\nangr\n\nMac OS X\npip install angrを唱える前に，私たちのフォーク版z3をpip install -I --no-use-wheel angr-only-z3-customのようにリビルドする必要があります．\nWindows\nangrをpipからwindows環境にインストールすることはできません．個別にコンポーネントをインストールする必要があります．\nCapstoneをWindowsにインストールするのは困難です．\nwheelを指定してインストールすることになりますが，しばしば&quot;capstone&quot;以外の名前でインストールされることがあります．その場合はcapstoneの記載をangrとarchinfoのrequirements.txtから除去してください．\nもしあなたがビルド環境に習熟しているなら，windowsでも問題なくZ3をコンパイルすることができます．\nそうでなければ，インターネットのどこかからwheelをダウンロードしてくるべきです．\n私たちのビルド済みwheelファイルはhttps://github.com/Owlz/angr-Windowsからダウンロード可能です．\nそれでもz3をソースからビルドする場合は，浮動小数点のサポートを含むz3のunstableブランチを利用してください．\nさらに，環境設定にZ3PATH=path/to/libz3.dllを加えてください．\n開発版インストール\n私たちはangr開発者たちの生活にゆとりを持たせるため，リポジトリとスクリプトを用意しました．\nangr開発版は次のようにセットアップできます：\ngit clone https://github.com/angr/angr-dev\ncd angr-dev\nmkvirtualenv angr\n./setup.sh\n\nこの手順は，全リポジトリをクローンしたのち編集可能なモードでインストールします．\nsetup.shは，さらに，PyPy virtualenvを作成し，パフォーマンスの向上とメモリ使用量の削減を実現します．\nさまざまなモジュールについて，所定の位置でブランチ作成・編集・再コンパイルすることができますが，その結果は自動的に仮想環境に反映されます．\nDockerインストール\n私たちは利便性のため，十中八九動作するDockerのイメージを提供しています．\nDockerは次のようにインストールできます：\n# dockerのインストール\ncurl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sudo sh\n\n# Dockerイメージのpull\nsudo docker pull angr/angr\n\n# 実行\nsudo docker run -it angr\n\nDocker内外とのファイル同期はユーザーへの課題として残されています（ヒント：docker -vを確認してください）．\nトラブルシューティング\nlibgomp.so.1: version GOMP_4.0 not found\nこのエラーはコンパイル済みangr-only-z3-customのバージョンとインストールされたlibgompのバージョンの不適合を意味します．次のようにZ3のコンパイルが必要となります：\npip install -I --no-use-wheel angr-only-z3-custom\n\nCan&#39;t import mulpyplexer\nmulpyplexerのインストールに問題が発生することがあります．\npip install --upgrade &#39;git+https://github.com/zardus/mulpyplexer&#39;が修正してくれるはずです．\nCan&#39;t import angr because of capstone\nangrで利用可能な状態でcapstoneがインストールされないことがあります．capstoneを再インストールしてこの問題を解決する，よい機会です：\npip install -I --no-use-wheel capstone\n\nImportError due to failure in loading capstone while importing angr\nvirtualenvまたはvirtualenvwrapper環境で，pipを用いてcapstone 3.0.4をインストールする際の既知の問題です．何人かのユーザーから，ネイティブなPython環境でも同様のバグが報告されています（Github上のバグレポートの議論を参照してください）．\n仮想環境で，capsyoneのPythonファイルが /home/&lt;username&gt;/.virtualenvs/&lt;virtualenv&gt;/lib/python2.7/site-packages/capstone/*.py(c)にインストールされている場合，capstoneのライブラリファイルは/home/&lt;username&gt;/.virtualenvs/&lt;virtualenv&gt;/lib/python2.7/site-packages/home/&lt;username&gt;/.virtualenvs/&lt;virtualenv&gt;/lib/python2.7/site-packages/capstone/libcapstone.soにあるはずです．\nネイティブ環境で，capstoneのPythonファイルが/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/capstone/*.py(c)にインストールされている場合，capstoneのライブラリファイルは/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/capstone/libcapstone.soにあるはずです．\nlibcapstone.soをPythonファイルと同じディレクトリに移動することで，問題を解決できるでしょう．\nClaripyとz3\nZ3のコンパイルは少しばかり奇妙です．理由なくビルドに失敗することもあります．いくつかのファイルやディレクトリに欠けていて，ファイルを作成できないのです．ビルドに再挑戦してください：\npip install -I --no-use-wheel angr-only-z3-custom\n\nNo such file or directory: &#39;pyvex_c&#39;\nUbuntu 12.04を使っていますか？　もしそうなら，アップグレードしてください！\npipのアップグレード (pip install -U pip) でも，問題を解決できるかもしれません．\n"},"HACKING.html":{"url":"HACKING.html","title":"コントリビュートするには","body":"バグ報告\nもしangrに解決できない問題があり，バグのような挙動を示したら，ぜひ私たちに知らせてください！\n\nangr/binariesとangr/angrをフォークし，\n問題のバイナリを添えてangr/binariesにプルリクエストを送ってください．\n問題のバイナリを読み込むangr/tests/broken_x.py, angr/tests/broken_y.py, などを添えてangr/angrにプルリクエストを送ってください．\n\nそのときは，楽にスクリプトをマージして実行できるよう，（コードをtest_なんとか関数として切り分けできるので）下記のテストケースの形式に従っていただきたいと思います．\n例：\ndef test_some_broken_feature():\n    p =

&#39;__main__&#39;:\n    test_some_broken_feature()\n\nこうしていただければ，バグの再現とその修正の著しい迅速化が見込めます．\n理想的な状況は，バグが修正されたとき，あなたのテストケースがパスする（すなわち，末尾のassertがAssertionErrorを引き起こさない）ことです．\nそうなれば，broken_x.pyはtest_x.pyにリネームされ，リポジトリにコードがプッシュされる度に私たちの内部CIが検証してくれるテストケースに追加されます．バグが修正されていることを保証するためです．\nangrの開発\nコードベースをよい状態にしておくための，いくつかのガイドラインがあります！\nコーディングスタイル\nクソッタレた状況を避け，合理的なコードを保つために，私たちはPEP8コーディング規約に準拠しようとしています．もしあなたがVimを使っているなら，python-modeプラグインがあなたの必要とするすべてを担います．もちろん手動で設定しても構いません．\nangrの一部としてコードを書くとき最も重要なのは，以下の点を考慮することです：\n\nどこであろうと，getterやsetterではなく属性アクセス（@propertyデコレータを参照）を利用してください．Javaじゃあるまいし．iPythonなら属性のタブ補完も効きます．とはいえ，合理的たれ：属性アクセスは高速であるべきです．経験則的に，何らかの制約解決が必要なものを属性として扱うべきではありません．\n\n私たちの用意した.pylintrcを利用してください．かなり寛容ではありますが，あなたのコードがpylintの要求する品質にそぐわなければ，CIサーバによるビルドは通りません．\n\nどのような状況下でも絶対にraise Exceptionまたはassert Falseを利用しないでください．例外の型を適切に扱ってください．適切な例外の型がなければ，作業中のモジュール（すなわち，angrであればAngrError, SimuVEXであればSimError, etc）のコア例外をサブクラス化して送出します．適切な場所，適切な型の例外は適切にキャッチされ，適切にハンドルされますが，AssertionErrorとExceptionは決してハンドルされず，解析を強制終了に追いやることになります．\n\nタブを避けてください；インデントには代わりにスペースを用いてください．たとえそれが過ちだとしても，スペース4つがデファクトスタンダードです．タブとスペースが混在したおぞましいコードをマージするよりは，最初からスペースを使った方が身のためです．\n\n長すぎる行の記述を避けてください．いや，別に構わないのですが，長い行にわたる記述を読むのは大変だし，一般的にやめておくべきだということを肝に銘じておいてください．文字数は120までという制限にこだわってみましょう．\n\nクソ長い関数を避けてください．より小さな機能に分割した方がよい場合が多いのですから．\n\n（デバッグ時にアクセスできるよう）プライベートなメンバの定義には__よりも_を選んでください．あなたは与えられた関数を誰もが参照できなければならないとは思わないかもしれませんが，どうか私たちを信頼してください．間違っているのはあなたの方なんです．\n\n\nドキュメンテーション\nコードを文書化してください．すべてのクラス定義とパブリックな関数定義にはいくつかの説明が必要です：\n\n何をするか．\nパラメータの型と意味．\n戻り値．\n\n私たちはSphinxを用いてAPIドキュメンテーションを生成しています．Sphinxは関数のパラメータや戻り値，戻り値の型などを自動で文書化するための特別な見出し語をサポートしています．\n関数のドキュメンテーション例を示します．そのままdocstringを読み込めるよう，パラメータの説明文は垂直に整列されている状態が理想です．\ndef prune(self, filter_func=None, from_stash=None, to_stash=None):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Prune unsatisfiable paths from a stash.\n\n    :param filter_func: Only prune paths that match this filter.\n    :param from_stash:  Prune paths from this stash. (default: &#39;active&#39;)\n    :param to_stash:    Put pruned paths in this stash.

More below.\nfactory.blank_state returns a SimState object with little initialization besides the parameters passed to it. States as a whole are discussed in depth here.\nfactory.entry_state returns a SimState initialized to the program state at the binary&#39;s entry point.\nfactory.call_state returns a SimState initialized as if you&#39;d just called the function at the given address, with the given args.\nfactory.full_init_state returns a SimState that initialized similarly to entry_state, but instead of at the entry point, the program counter points to a SimProcedure that serves the purpose of the dynamic loader and will call the initializers of each shared library before jumping to the entry point.\nfactory.path returns a Path object. Since Paths are at their start just light wrappers around SimStates, you can call path with a state as an argument and get a path wrapped around that state.\nAlternately, for simple cases, any keyword arguments you pass path will be passed on to entry_state to create a state to wrap. It is discussed in depth here.\nfactory.path_group creates a path group! Path groups are the future. They&#39;re basically very smart lists of paths, so you can pass it a path, a state (which will be wrapped into a path), or a list of paths and states. They are discussed in depth here.\nfactory.callable is very cool. Callables are a FFI (foreign functions interface) into arbitrary binary code. They are discussed in depth here.\nfactory.cc intiializes a calling convention object. This can be initialized with different args or even a function prototype, and then passed to factory.callable or factory.call_state to customize how arguments and return values and return addresses are laid out into memory. It is discussed in depth here.\n\nLifter\nAccess the lifter through factory.block.\nThis method has a number of optional parameters, which you can read about here!\nThe bottom line, though, is that block() gives you back a generic interface to a basic block of code.\nYou can get properties like .size (in bytes) from the block, but if you want to do interesting things with it, you need a more specific representation.\nAccess .vex to get a PyVEX IRSB, or .capstone to get a Capstone block.\nFilesystem Options\nThere are a number of options which can be passed to the state initialization routines which affect filesystem usage. These include the fs, concrete_fs, and chroot options.\nThe fs option allows you to pass in a dictionary of file names to preconfigured SimFile objects. This allows you to do things like set a concrete size limit on a file&#39;s content.\nSetting the concrete_fs option to True will cause angr to respect the files on disk. For example, if during simulation a program attempts to open &#39;banner.txt&#39; when concrete_fs is set to False (the default), a SimFile with a symbolic memory backing will be created and simulation will continue as though the file exists. When concrete_fs mode is set to True, if &#39;banner.txt&#39; exists a new SimFile object will be created with a concrete backing, reducing the resulting state explosion which would be caused by operating on a completely symbolic file. Additionally in concrete_fs mode if &#39;banner.txt&#39; mode does not exist, a SimFile object will not be created upon calls to open during simulation and an error code will be returned. Additionally, it&#39;s important to note that attempts to open files whose path begins with &#39;/dev/&#39; will never be opened concretely even with concrete_fs set to True.\nThe chroot option allows you to specify an optional root to use while using the concrete_fs option. This can be convenient if the program you&#39;re analyzing references files using an absolute path. For example, if the program you are analyzing attempts to open &#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, you can set the chroot to your current working directory so that attempts to access &#39;/etc/passwd&#39; will read from &#39;$CWD/etc/passwd&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import simuvex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; files = {&#39;/dev/stdin&#39;: simuvex.storage.file.SimFile(&quot;/dev/stdin&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, size=30)}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b.factory.entry_state(fs=files, concrete_fs=True, chroot=&quot;angr-chroot/&quot;)\n\nThis example will create a state which constricts at most 30 symbolic bytes from being read from stdin and will cause references to files to be resolved concretely within the new root directory angr-chroot.\nImportant note that needs to go in this initial version before I write the rest of the stuff:\nthe args and env keyword args work on entry_state and full_init_state, and are a list and a dict, respectively, of strings or claripy BV objects, which can represent a variety of concrete and symbolic strings.

Instead of an address, you pass it the name of a function that that binary imports.\nThe internal (GOT) pointer to the code that function resolved to will be replaced with a pointer to the SimProcedure or hook function you specify in the third argument.

CLE is responsible for taking a binary (and any libraries that it depends on) and presenting it to the rest of angr in a way that is easy to work with.\nCLE&#39;s main goal is to load binaries in a robust way, i.e., the same way the actual loader (e.g., GNU LD in the case of ELF binaries) would load them. It means that some information that may be present in the binaries will be ignored by CLE, because such information may be stripped, voluntarily or involuntarily corrupted, etc.. It is not rare in the embedded world to see such things happening.\nangr, in turn, encompasses this in a Project class. A Project class is the entity that represents your binary. Much of your interaction with angr will go through it.\nTo load a binary with angr (let&#39;s say &quot;/bin/true&quot;), you would do the following:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&quot;/bin/true&quot;)\n\nAfter this, b is angr&#39;s representation of your binary (the &quot;main&quot; binary), along with any libraries that it depends on. There are several basic things that you can do here without further knowledge of the rest of the platform:\n# this is the entry point of the binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.entry\n\n# these are the minimum and maximum addresses of the binary&#39;s memory contents\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.min_addr(), b.loader.max_addr()\n\n# this is the full name of the binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.filename\n\nCLE exposes the binary&#39;s information through the Loader class. The CLE loader (cle.Loader) represents an entire conglomerate of loaded CLE binary objects, loaded and mapped into a single memory space. Each binary object is loaded by a loader backend that can handle its filetype (a subclass of cle.Backend). For example, cle.ELF is used to load ELF binaries.\nCLE can be interfaced with as follows:\n# this is the CLE Loader object\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader\n\n# this is a dictionary of the objects that are loaded as part of loading the binary (their types depend on the backend)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.shared_objects\n\n# this is the memory space of the process after being loaded. It maps addresses to the byte at that address.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.memory[b.loader.min_addr()]\n\n# this is the object for the main binary (its type depends on the backend)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.main_bin\n\n# this retrieves the binary object which maps memory at the specified address\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.addr_belongs_to_object(b.loader.max_addr())\n\n# Get the address of the GOT slot for a symbol (in the main binary)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.find_symbol_got_entry(&#39;__libc_start_main&#39;)\n\nIt is also possible to interface directly with individual binary objects:\n# this is a list of the names of libraries the program depend on. We obtain it\n# *statically* by reading the DT_NEEDED field of the dynamic section of the Elf\n# binary.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.main_bin.deps\n\n# this is a dict of the memory contents of *just* the main binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.main_bin.memory\n\n# this is a dict (name-&gt;ELFRelocation) of imports required by the libc which was loaded\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.loader.shared_objects[&#39;libc.so.6&#39;].imports\n\n# this is a dict (name-&gt;ELFRelocation) of imports of the main binary, where addr is usually 0 (see the misc section below).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b.loader.main_bin.imports\n\nLoading dependencies\nBy default, CLE will attempt to load all the dependencies of the main binary (e.g., libc.so.6, ld-linux.so.2, etc.), unless auto_load_libs is set to False in the loading options. When loading libraries, if it cannot find one of them, it will silently ignore the error and mark all the dependencies on that library as unresolved. If you like, you can change this behavior.\nLoading Options\nLoading options can be passed to Project (which in turn will pass it to CLE). \nCLE expects a dict as a set of parameters. Parameters which must be applied to libraries which \nare not the target binary must be passed through the lib_opts parameter in the following form:\nload_options = {&#39;main_opts&#39;:{options0}, &#39;lib_opts&#39;: {libname1:{options1}, path2:{options2}, ...}}\n\n# Or in a more readable form:\nload_options = {}\nload_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {k1:v1, k2:v2 ...}\nload_options[&#39;lib_opts&#39;] = {}\nload_options[&#39;lib_opts&#39;][path1] = {k1:v1, k2:v2, ...}\nload_options[&#39;lib_opts&#39;][path2] = {k1:v1, k2:v2, ...}\netc.\n\nValid options\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options = {}\n\n# shall we also load dynamic libraries?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;auto_load_libs&#39;] = False\n\n# A list of libraries to load regardless of whether they&#39;re required by the loaded object\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;force_load_libs&#39;] = [&#39;libleet.so&#39;]\n\n# specific libs to skip\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;skip_libs&#39;] = [&#39;libc.so.6&#39;]\n\n# Options to be used when loading the main binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {&#39;backend&#39;: &#39;elf&#39;}\n\n# A dictionary mapping library names to a dictionary of objects to be used when loading them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;lib_opts&#39;] = {&#39;libc.so.6&#39;: {&#39;custom_base_addr&#39;: 0x13370000}}\n\n# A list of paths we can additionally search for shared libraries\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;custom_ld_path&#39;] = [&#39;/my/fav/libs&#39;]\n\n# Whether libraries with different version numbers in the filename will be considered equivilant, for example libc.so.6 and libc.so.0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;ignore_import_version_numbers&#39;] = False\n\n# The alignment to use for rebasing shared objects\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;rebase_granularity&#39;] = 0x1000\n\n# Throw an Exception if a lib cannot be found (the default is fail silently on missing libs)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;except_missing_libs&#39;] = True\n\nThe following options are applied on a per object basis and override CLE&#39;s automatic detection. \nThey can be applied through either &#39;main_opts&#39; or &#39;lib_opts&#39;.\n# Base address to load the binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {&#39;custom_base_addr&#39;:0x4000}\n\n# Specify the object&#39;s backend (backends discussed below)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {&#39;backend&#39;: &#39;elf&#39;}\n\nExample with multiple options for the same binary:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {&#39;backend&#39;:&#39;elf&#39;, &#39;custom_base_addr&#39;: 0x10000}\n\nBackends\nCLE currently has backends for statically loading ELF, PE, CGC and ELF core dump files, as well as loading binaries with IDA and loading files into a flat address space. CLE will automatically detect the correct backend to use in most all cases, so you shouldn&#39;t need to specify which backend you&#39;re using unless you&#39;re doing some pretty weird stuff.\nYou can specify the backend for a binary by including a key in its options dictionary. If you need to force the architecture of a certain binary instead of having it auto-detected, you can specify it with the custom_arch key. The key doesn&#39;t need to match any list of arches; angr will identify which architecture you mean given almost any common identifier for any supported arch.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options = {}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;main_opts&#39;] = {&#39;backend&#39;: &#39;elf&#39;, &#39;custom_arch&#39;: &#39;i386&#39;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt; load_options[&#39;lib_opts&#39;] = {&#39;libc.so.6&#39;: {&#39;backend&#39;: &#39;elf&#39;}}\n\n\n\n\nbackend key\ndescription\nrequires custom_arch?\n\n\n\n\nelf\nStatic loader for ELF files based on PyELFTools\nno\n\n\npe\nStatic loader for PE files based on PEFile\nno\n\n\ncgc\nStatic loader for Cyber Grand Challenge binaries\nno\n\n\nbackedcgc\nStatic loader for CGC binaries that allows specifying memory and register backers\nno\n\n\nelfcore\nStatic loader for ELF core dumps\nno\n\n\nida\nLaunches an instance of IDA to parse the file\nyes\n\n\nblob\nLoads the file into memory as a flat image\nyes\n\n\n\nNow that you have loaded a binary, interesting information about the binary is now accessible in b.loader.main_bin. For example, the shared library dependencies, the list of imported libraries, memory, symbols and others. \nMake heavy use of IPython&#39;s tab-completion to see available functions and options here.\nNow it&#39;s time to look at the IR support\nMisc\nImports\nThe following is ELF specific.\nOn most architectures, imports, i.e., symbols that refer to functions or global names that are outside of the binary (in shared libraries) appear in the symbol table, most of the time with an undefined address (0). On some architectures like MIPS, it contains the address of the function&#39;s PLT stub (which resides in the text segment).\nIf you are looking for the address of the GOT entry related to a specific symbol (which resides in the data segment), take a look at jmprel. It is a dict (symbol-&gt; GOT addr):\nWhether you are after a PLT or GOT entry depends on the architecture. Architecture specific stuff is defined in a class in the Archinfo repository. The way we deal with absolute addresses of functions depending on the architecture is defined in this class, in the got_section_name property.\nFor more details about ELF loading and architecture specific details, check the Executable and linkable format document as well as the ABI supplements for each architecture (MIPS, PPC64, AMD64)..\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rel = b.loader.main_bin.jmprel\n\nSymbolic analysis: function summaries\nBy default, Project tries to replace external calls to libraries&#39; functions by using symbolic summaries termed SimProcedures (these are summaries of how functions affect the state). \nWhen no such summary is available for a given function:\n\nif auto_load_libs is True (this is the default), then the real library function is executed instead. This may or may not be what you want, depending on the actual function. For example, some of libc&#39;s functions are extremely complex to analyze and will most likely cause an explosion of the number of states for the path trying to execute them.\nif auto_load_libs is False, then external functions are unresolved, and Project will resolve them to a generic &quot;stub&quot; SimProcedure called ReturnUnconstrained. It does what its name says: it returns unconstrained values.\nif use_sim_procedures (this is a parameter to angr.Project, not cle.Loader) is False (it is True by default), then no SimProcedures besides ReturnUnconstrained will be used.\nyou may specify specific symbols to exclude from being replaced with SimProcedures with the parameters to angr.Project: exclude_sim_procedures_list and exclude_sim_procedures_func.\nLook at the code for angr.Project._use_sim_procedures for the exact algorithm.\n\n"},"docs/ir.html":{"url":"docs/ir.html","title":"中間表現","body":"Intermediate Representation\nBecause angr deals with widely diverse architectures, it must carry out its analysis on an intermediate representation. We use Valgrind&#39;s IR, &quot;VEX&quot;, for this. The VEX IR abstracts away several architecture differences when dealing with different architectures, allowing a single analysis to be run on all of them:\n\nRegister names. The quantity and names of registers differ between architectures, but modern CPU designs hold to a common theme: each CPU contains several general purpose registers, a register to hold the stack pointer, a set of registers to store condition flags, and so forth. The IR provides a consistent, abstracted interface to registers on different platforms. Specifically, VEX models the registers as a separate memory space, with integer offsets (e.g., AMD64&#39;s rax is stored starting at address 16 in this memory space).\nMemory access. Different architectures access memory in different ways. For example, ARM can access memory in both little-endian and big-endian modes. The IR must abstracts away these differences.\nMemory segmentation. Some architectures, such as x86, support memory segmentation through the use of special segment registers. The IR understands such memory access mechanisms.\nInstruction side-effects. Most instructions have side-effects. For example, most operations in Thumb mode on ARM update the condition flags, and stack push/pop instructions update the stack pointer. Tracking these side-effects in an ad hoc manner in the analysis would be crazy, so the IR makes these effects explicit.\n\nThere are lots of choices for an IR. We use VEX, since the uplifting of binary code into VEX is quite well supported.\nVEX is an architecture-agnostic, side-effects-free representation of a number of target machine languages.\nIt abstracts machine code into a representation designed to make program analysis easier.\nThis representation has four main classes of objects:\n\nExpressions. IR Expressions represent a calculated or constant value. This includes memory loads, register reads, and results of arithmetic operations.\nOperations. IR Operations describe a modification of IR Expressions. This includes integer arithmetic, floating-point arithmetic, bit operations, and so forth. An IR Operation applied to IR Expressions yields an IR Expression as a result.\nTemporary variables. VEX uses temporary variables as internal registers: IR Expressions are stored in temporary variables between use. The content of a temporary variable can be retrieved using an IR Expression. These temporaries are numbered, starting at t0. These temporaries are strongly typed (e.g., &quot;64-bit integer&quot; or &quot;32-bit float&quot;).\nStatements. IR Statements model changes in the state of the target machine, such as the effect of memory stores and register writes. IR Statements use IR Expressions for values they may need. For example, a memory store IR Statement uses an IR Expression for the target address of the write, and another IR Expression for the content.\nBlocks. An IR Block is a collection of IR Statements, representing an extended basic block (termed &quot;IR Super Block&quot; or &quot;IRSB&quot;) in the target architecture. A block can have several exits. For conditional exits from the middle of a basic block, a special Exit IR Statement is used. An IR Expression is used to represent the target of the unconditional exit at the end of the block.\n\nVEX IR is actually quite well documented in the libvex_ir.h file (https://github.com/angr/vex/blob/master/pub/libvex_ir.h) in the VEX repository. For the lazy, we&#39;ll detail some parts of VEX that you&#39;ll likely interact with fairly frequently. To begin with, here are some IR Expressions:\n\n\n\nIR Expression\nEvaluated Value\nVEX Output Example\n\n\n\n\nConstant\nA constant value.\n0x4:I32\n\n\nRead Temp\nThe value stored in a VEX temporary variable.\nRdTmp(t10)\n\n\nGet Register\nThe value stored in a register.\nGET:I32(16)\n\n\nLoad Memory\nThe value stored at a memory address, with the address specified by another IR Expression.\nLDle:I32 / LDbe:I64\n\n\nOperation\nA result of a specified IR Operation, applied to specified IR Expression arguments.\nAdd32\n\n\nIf-Then-Else\nIf a given IR Expression evaluates to 0, return one IR Expression. Otherwise, return another.\nITE\n\n\nHelper Function\nVEX uses C helper functions for certain operations, such as computing the conditional flags registers of certain architectures. These functions return IR Expressions.\nfunction_name()\n\n\n\nThese expressions are then, in turn, used in IR Statements. Here are some common ones:\n\n\n\nIR Statement\nMeaning\nVEX Output Example\n\n\n\n\nWrite Temp\nSet a VEX temporary variable to the value of the given IR Expression.\nWrTmp(t1) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nPut Register\nUpdate a register with the value of the given IR Expression.\nPUT(16) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nStore Memory\nUpdate a location in memory, given as an IR Expression, with a value, also given as an IR Expression.\nSTle(0x1000) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nExit\nA conditional exit from a basic block, with the jump target specified by an IR Expression. The condition is specified by an IR Expression.\nif (condition) goto (Boring) 0x4000A00:I32\n\n\n\nAn example of an IR translation, on ARM, is produced below. In the example, the subtraction operation is translated into a single IR block comprising 5 IR Statements, each of which contains at least one IR Expression (although, in real life, an IR block would typically consist of more than one instruction). Register names are translated into numerical indices given to the GET Expression and PUT Statement.\nThe astute reader will observe that the actual subtraction is modeled by the first 4 IR Statements of the block, and the incrementing of the program counter to point to the next instruction (which, in this case, is located at 0x59FC8) is modeled by the last statement.\nThe following ARM instruction:\nsubs R2, R2, #8\nBecomes this VEX IR:\nt0 = GET:I32(16)\nt1 = 0x8:I32\nt3 = Sub32(t0,t1)\nPUT(16) = t3\nPUT(68) = 0x59FC8:I32\nNow that you understand VEX, you can actually play with some VEX in angr: We use a library called PyVEX (https://github.com/angr/pyvex) that exposes VEX into Python. In addition, PyVEX implements its own pretty-printing so that it can show register names instead of register offsets in PUT and GET instructions.\nPyVEX is accessable through angr through the Project.factory.block interface. There are many different representations you could use to access syntactic properties of a block of code, but they all have in common the trait of analyzing a particular sequence of bytes. Through the factory.block constructor, you get a Block object that can be easily turned into several different representations. Try .vex for a PyVEX IRSB, or .capstone for a Capstone block.\nLet&#39;s play with PyVEX:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n\n# load the program binary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&quot;/bin/true&quot;)\n\n# translate the starting basic block\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irsb = b.factory.block(b.entry).vex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irsb.pp()\n\n# translate a basic block starting at an address\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irsb = b.factory.block(0x401340).vex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irsb.pp()\n\n# this is the IR Expression of the jump target of the unconditional exit at the end of the basic block\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print irsb.next\n\n# this is the type of the unconditional exit (e.g., a call, ret, syscall, etc)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print irsb.jumpkind\n\n# you can also pretty-print it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irsb.next.pp()\n\n# iterate through each statement and print all the statements\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     stmt.pp()\n\n# pretty-print the IR expression representing the data, and the *type* of that IR expression written by every store statement\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyvex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     if isinstance(stmt, pyvex.IRStmt.Store):\n...         print &quot;Data:&quot;,\n...         stmt.data.pp()\n...         print &quot;&quot;\n...         print &quot;Type:&quot;,\n...         print stmt.data.result_type\n...         print &quot;&quot;\n\n# pretty-print the condition and jump target of every conditional exit from the basic block\n... for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     if isinstance(stmt, pyvex.IRStmt.Exit):\n...         print &quot;Condition:&quot;,\n...         stmt.guard.pp()\n...         print &quot;&quot;\n...         print &quot;Target:&quot;,\n...         stmt.dst.pp()\n...         print &quot;&quot;\n\n# these are the types of every temp in the IRSB\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print irsb.tyenv.types\n\n# here is one way to get the type of temp 0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print irsb.tyenv.types[0]\n\nKeep in mind that this is a syntactic respresentation of a basic block. That is, it&#39;ll tell you what the block means, but you don&#39;t have any context to say, for example, what actual data is written by a store instruction. We&#39;ll get to that next.\n"},"docs/claripy.html":{"url":"docs/claripy.html","title":"ソルバエンジン","body":"Solver Engine\nangr&#39;s solver engine is called Claripy.

It is pretty badass.\nMost users of angr will not need to interact directly with Claripy (except for, maybe, claripy AST objects, which represent symbolic expressions) -- SimuVEX handles most interactions with Claripy internally.\nHowever, for dealing with expressions, an understanding of Claripy might be useful.\nClaripy ASTs\nClaripy ASTs abstract away the differences between the constructs that Claripy supports.\nThey define a tree of operations (i.e., (a + b) / c) on any type of underlying data.\nClaripy handles the application of these operations on the underlying objects themselves by dispatching requests to the backends.\nCurrently, Claripy supports the following types of ASTs:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nSupported By (Claripy Backends)\nExample Code\n\n\n\n\nBV\nThis is a bitvector, whether symbolic (with a name) or concrete (with a value).

Create a 32-bit bitvectory with the value 0xc001b3475: claripy.BVV(0xc001b3a75, 32). Create a 32-bit &quot;strided interval&quot; (see VSA documentation) that can be any divisible-by-10 number between 1000 and 2000: claripy.SI(name=&#39;x&#39;, bits=32, lower_bound=1000, upper_bound=2000, stride=10)\n\n\nFP\nThis is a floating-point number, whether symbolic (with a name) or concrete (with a value).\nBackendConcrete, BackendZ3\nTODO\n\n\nBool\nThis is a boolean operation (True or False).\nBackendConcrete, BackendVSA, BackendZ3\nclaripy.BoolV(True), or claripy.true or claripy.false, or by comparing two ASTs (i.e., claripy.BVS(&#39;x&#39;, 32) &lt; claripy.BVS(&#39;y&#39;, 32)\n\n\n\nAll of the above creation code returns claripy.AST objects, on which operations can then be carried out.\nASTs provide several useful operations.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import claripy\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bv = claripy.BVV(0x41424344, 32)\n\n# Size - you can get the size of an AST with .size()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert bv.size() == 32\n\n# Reversing - .reversed is the reversed version of the BVV\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert bv.reversed is claripy.BVV(0x44434241, 32)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert bv.reversed.reversed is bv\n\n# Depth - you can get the depth of the AST\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print bv.depth\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert bv.depth == 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x = claripy.BVS(&#39;x&#39;, 32)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert (x+bv).depth == 2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert ((x+bv)/10).depth == 3\n\nApplying a condition (==, !=, etc) on ASTs will return an AST that represents the condition being carried out.\nFor example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = bv == x\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert isinstance(r, claripy.ast.Bool)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = bv == bv\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert isinstance(p, claripy.ast.Bool)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert p.is_true()\n\nYou can combine these conditions in different ways.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; q = claripy.And(claripy.Or(bv == x, bv * 2 == x, bv * 3 == x), x == 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert isinstance(p, claripy.ast.Bool)\n\nThe usefulness of this will become apparent when we discuss Claripy solvers.\nIn general, Claripy supports all of the normal python operations (+, -, |, ==, etc), and provides additional ones via the Claripy instance object. Here&#39;s a list of available operations from the latter.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nLShR\nLogically shifts a bit expression (BVV, BV, SI) to the right.\nclaripy.LShR(x, 10)\n\n\nSignExt\nSign-extends a bit expression.\nclaripy.SignExt(32, x) or x.sign_extend(32)\n\n\nZeroExt\nZero-extends a bit expression.\nclaripy.ZeroExt(32, x) or x.zero_extend(32)\n\n\nExtract\nExtracts the given bits (zero-indexed from the right, inclusive) from a bit expression.\nExtract the rightmost byte of x: claripy.Extract(7, 0, x) or x[7:0]\n\n\nConcat\nConcatenates several bit expressions together into a new bit expression.\nclaripy.Concat(x, y, z)\n\n\nRotateLeft\nRotates a bit expression left.\nclaripy.RotateLeft(x, 8)\n\n\nRotateRight\nRotates a bit expression right.\nclaripy.RotateRight(x, 8)\n\n\nReverse\nReverses a bit expression.\nclaripy.Reverse(x) or x.reversed\n\n\nAnd\nLogical And (on boolean expressions)\nclaripy.And(x == y, x &gt; 0)\n\n\nOr\nLogical Or (on boolean expressions)\nclaripy.Or(x == y, y &lt; 10)\n\n\nNot\nLogical Not (on a boolean expression)\nclaripy.Not(x == y) is the same as x != y\n\n\nIf\nAn If-then-else\nChoose the maximum of two expressions: claripy.If(x &gt; y, x, y)\n\n\nULE\nUnsigned less than or equal to.\nCheck if x is less than or equal to y: claripy.ULE(x, y)\n\n\nULT\nUnsigned less than.\nCheck if x is less than y: claripy.ULT(x, y)\n\n\nUGE\nUnsigned greater than or equal to.\nCheck if x is greater than or equal to y: claripy.UGE(x, y)\n\n\nUGT\nUnsigned greater than.\nCheck if x is greater than y: claripy.UGT(x, y)\n\n\nSLE\nSigned less than or equal to.\nCheck if x is less than or equal to y: claripy.SLE(x, y)\n\n\nSLT\nSigned less than.\nCheck if x is less than y: claripy.SLT(x, y)\n\n\nSGE\nSigned greater than or equal to.\nCheck if x is greater than or equal to y: claripy.SGE(x, y)\n\n\nSGT\nSigned greater than.\nCheck if x is greater than y: claripy.SGT(x, y)\n\n\n\nNOTE: The default python &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, and &lt;= are unsigned in Claripy. This is different than their behavior in Z3, because it seems more natural in binary analysis.\nSolvers\nThe main point of interaction with Claripy are the Claripy Solvers.\nSolvers expose an API to interpret ASTs in different ways and return usable values.\nThere are several different solvers.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSolver\nThis is analogous to a z3.Solver(). It is a solver that tracks constraints on symbolic variables and uses a constraint solver (currently, Z3) to evaluate symbolic expressions.\n\n\nSolverVSA\nThis solver uses VSA to reason about values. It is an approximating solver, but produces values without performing actual constraint solves.\n\n\nSolverReplacement\nThis solver acts as a pass-through to a child solver, allowing the replacement of expressions on-the-fly. It is used as a helper by other solvers and can be used directly to implement exotic analyses.\n\n\nSolverHybrid\nThis solver combines the SolverReplacement and the Solver (VSA and Z3) to allow for approximating values. You can specify whether or not you want an exact result from your evaluations, and this solver does the rest.\n\n\nSolverComposite\nThis solver implements optimizations that solve smaller sets of constraints to speed up constraint solving.\n\n\n\nSome examples of solver usage:\n# create the solver and an expression\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = claripy.Solver()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x = claripy.BVS(&#39;x&#39;, 8)\n\n# now let&#39;s add a constraint on x\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(claripy.ULT(x, 5))\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert sorted(s.eval(x, 10)) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.max(x) == 4\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.min(x) == 0\n\n# we can also get the values of complex expressions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; y = claripy.BVV(65, 8)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; z = claripy.If(x == 1, x, y)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert sorted(s.eval(z, 10)) == [1, 65]\n\n# and, of course, we can add constraints on complex expressions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(z % 5 != 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.eval(z, 10) == (1,)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.eval(x, 10) == (1,) # interestingly enough, since z can&#39;t be y, x can only be 1!\n\nCustom solvers can be built by combining a Claripy Frontend (the class that handles the actual interaction with SMT solver or the underlying data domain) and some combination of frontend mixins (that handle things like caching, filtering out duplicate constraints, doing opportunistic simplification, and so on).\nClaripy Backends\nBackends are Claripy&#39;s workhorses.\nClaripy exposes ASTs to the world, but when actual computation has to be done, it pushes those ASTs into objects that can be handled by the backends themselves.\nThis provides a unified interface to the outside world while allowing Claripy to support different types of computation.\nFor example, BackendConcrete provides computation support for concrete bitvectors and booleans, BackendVSA introduces VSA constructs such as StridedIntervals (and details what happens when operations are performed on them, and BackendZ3 provides support for symbolic variables and constraint solving.\nThere are a set of functions that a backend is expected to implement.\nFor all of these functions, the &quot;public&quot; version is expected to be able to deal with claripy&#39;s AST objects, while the &quot;private&quot; version should only deal with objects specific to the backend itself.\nThis is distinguished with Python idioms: a public function will be named func() while a private function will be _func().\nAll functions should return objects that are usable by the backend in its private methods.\nIf this can&#39;t be done (i.e., some functionality is being attempted that the backend can&#39;t handle), the backend should raise a BackendError.\nIn this case, Claripy will move on to the next backend in its list.\nAll backends must implement a convert() function.\nThis function receives a claripy AST and should return an object that the backend can handle in its private methods.\nBackends should also implement a _convert() method, which will receive anything that is not a claripy AST object (i.e., an integer or an object from a different backend).\nIf convert() or _convert() receives something that the backend can&#39;t translate to a format that is usable internally, the backend should raise BackendError, and thus won&#39;t be used for that object.\nAll backends must also implement any functions of the base Backend abstract class that currently raise NotImplementedError().\nClaripy&#39;s contract with its backends is as follows: backends should be able to handle, in their private functions, any object that they return from their private or public functions.\nClaripy will never pass an object to any backend private function that did not originate as a return value from a private or public function of that backend.\nOne exception to this is convert() and _convert(), as Claripy can try to stuff anything it feels like into _convert() to see if the backend can handle that type of object.\nModel Objects\nTo perform actual, useful computation on ASTs, Claripy uses model objects.\nA model object is a result of the operation represented by the AST.\nClaripy expects these objects to be returned from the backends, and will pass such objects into that backend&#39;s other functions.\n"},"docs/states.html":{"url":"docs/states.html","title":"プログラムの状態管理","body":"Machine State - memory, registers, and so on\nangr (actually, a submodule of angr, called SimuVEX) tracks machine states in a SimState object.\nThis object tracks concrete and/or symbolic values for the machine&#39;s memory, registers, along with various other information, such as open files.\nYou can get a SimState by using one of a number of convenient constructors in Project.factory.\nThe different basic states you can construct are described here.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr, simuvex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;/bin/true&#39;)\n\n# let&#39;s get a state at the program entry point:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b.factory.entry_state()\n\n# we can access the memory of the state here\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;The first 5 bytes of the binary are:&quot;, s.memory.load(b.loader.min_addr(), 5)\n\n# and the registers, of course\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;The stack pointer starts out as:&quot;, s.regs.sp\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;The instruction pointer starts out as:&quot;, s.regs.ip\n\n# and the temps, although these are currently empty\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # print &quot;This will throw an exception because there is no VEX temp t0, yet:&quot;, s.scratch.tmp_expr(0)\n\nAccessing Data\nThe data that&#39;s stored in the state (i.e., data in registers, memory, temps, etc) is stored as an internal expression. This exposes a single interface to concrete (i.e., 0x41414141) and symbolic (i.e., &quot;whatever the user might input on stdin&quot;) expressions. In fact, this is the core of what enables angr to analyze binaries symbolically. However, this complicates matters by not exposing the actual value, if it&#39;s concrete, directly. For example, if you try the above examples, you will see that the type that is printed is a claripy AST, which is the internal expression representation. For now, you might want to know how to get the actual values out of these expressions.\n# get the integer value of the content of rax:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_int(s.regs.rax)\n\n# or, the string value of the 10 bytes stored at 0x1000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_str(s.memory.load(0x1000, 10))\n\n# get the value of the 4 bytes stored at 0x2000, i.e. a little-endian int\n# note that unless otherwise specified, all loads from memory are big-endian by default\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_int(s.memory.load(0x2000, 4, endness=&#39;Iend_LE&#39;))\n\nHere, s.se is a solver engine that holds the symbolic constraints on the state.\nThis syntax might seem a bit strange -- we get the expression from the state, and then we pass it back into the state to get its actual value. This is, in fact, quite intentional. As we mentioned earlier, these expressions could be either concrete or symbolic. In the case of the latter, a symbolic expression might resolve to two different meanings in two different states. We&#39;ll go over symbolic expressions in more detail later on. For now, accept the mystery.\nStoring Data\nIf you want to store content in the state&#39;s memory or registers, you&#39;ll need to create an expression out of it. You can do it like so:\n# this creates a BVV (which stands for BitVector Value). A BVV is a bitvector that&#39;s used to represent\n# data in memory, registers, and temps. This BVV represents a 32 bit bitvector of four ascii `A` characters\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import claripy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaaa = claripy.BVV(0x41414141, 32)\n\n# While we&#39;re at it, we can do various operations on these bitvectors:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aa = aaaa[31:16] # this extracts the most significant 16 bits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aa00 = aaaa &amp; claripy.BVV(0xffff0000, 32)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaab = aaaa + 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaaaaaaa = claripy.Concat(aaaa, aaaa)\n\n# this can then be stored in memory or registers. Since the bitvector\n# has a length, only the address to store it at is required\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.regs.rax = aaaa\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.memory.store(0x1000, aaaa)\n\n# of course, you can address memory using expressions as well\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.memory.store(s.regs.rax, aaaa)\n\nFor convenience, there are special accessor functions stack operations:\n# push our &quot;AAAA&quot; onto the stack\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.stack_push(aaaa)\n\n# and pop it off\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaaa = s.stack_pop()\n\nCopying and Merging\nA state supports very fast copies, so that you can explore different possibilities:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = s.copy()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = s.copy()\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.memory.store(0x1000, s1.se.BVV(0x41414141, 32))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s2.memory.store(0x1000, s2.se.BVV(0x42424242, 32))\n\nStates can also be merged together.\n# merge will return a tuple. the first element is the merged state\n# the second element is a symbolic variable describing a state flag\n# the third element is a boolean describing whether any merging was done\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (s_merged, m, anything_merged) = s1.merge(s2)\n\n# this is now an expression that can resolve to &quot;AAAA&quot; *or* &quot;BBBB&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaaa_or_bbbb = s_merged.memory.load(0x1000, 4)\n\nThis is where we truly start to enter the realm of symbolic expressions. In the above example, the value of aaaa_or_bbbb can be, as it implies, either &quot;AAAA&quot; or &quot;BBBB&quot;.\nSymbolic Expressions\nSymbolic values are expressions that, under different situations, can take on different values. Our symbolic expression, aaaa_or_bbbb is a great example of this.  The solver engine provides ways to get at both values:\n# this will return a sequence of up to n possible values of the expression in this state.\n# in our case, there are only two values, and it&#39;ll return [ &quot;AAAA&quot;, &quot;BBBB&quot; ]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;This has 2 values:&quot;, s_merged.se.any_n_str(aaaa_or_bbbb, 2)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;This *would* have up to 5, but there are only two available:&quot;, s_merged.se.any_n_str(aaaa_or_bbbb, 5)\n\n# there&#39;s also the same for the integer value\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s_merged.se.any_n_int(aaaa_or_bbbb, 2)\n\nOf course, there are other ways to encounter symbolic expression than merging. For example, you can create them outright:\n# This creates a simple symbolic expression: just a single symbolic bitvector by itself. The bitvector is 32-bits long.\n# An auto-incrementing numerical ID, and the size, are appended to the name, since names of symbolic bitvectors must be unique.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v = s.se.BVS(&quot;some_name&quot;, 32)\n\n# If you want to prevent appending the ID and size to the name, you can, instead, do:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v = s.se.BVS(&quot;some_name&quot;, 32, explicit_name=True)\n\nSymbolic expressions can be interacted with in the same way as normal (concrete) bitvectors. In fact, you can even mix them:\n# Create a concrete and a symbolic expression\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v = s.se.BVS(&quot;some_name&quot;, 32)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aaaa = s.se.BVV(0x41414141, 32)\n\n# Do operations involving them, and retrieve possible numerical solutions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_int(aaaa)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_int(aaaa + v)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_int((aaaa + v) | s.se.BVV(0xffff0000, 32))\n\n# You can tell between symbolic and concrete expressions fairly easily:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.symbolic(v)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert not s.se.symbolic(aaaa)\n\n# You can even tell *which* variables make up a given expression.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.variables(aaaa) == set()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; #assert s.se.variables(aaaa + v) == { &quot;some_name_4_32&quot; } # that&#39;s the ID and size appended to the name\n# This assertion will fail because it depends on precisely the number of symbolic values previously created\n\nAs you can see, symbolic and concrete expressions are pretty interchangeable, which is an extremely useful abstraction provided by SimuVEX. You might also notice that, when you read from memory locations that were never written to, you receive symbolic expressions:\n# Try it!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; m = s.memory.load(0xbbbb0000, 8)\n\n# The result is symbolic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.symbolic(m)\n\n# Along with the ID and length, the address at which this expression originated is also added to the name\n&gt;&gt;&gt; #assert s.se.variables(m) == { &quot;mem_bbbb0000_5_64&quot; }\n\n# And, of course, we can get the numerical or string solutions for the expression\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_n_int(m, 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.se.any_str(m)\n\nSo far, we&#39;ve seen addition being used. But we can do much more. All of the following examples return new expressions, with the operation applied.\n# mods aaaa by 0x100, creating an expression, of the same size as aaaa, with all but the last byte zeroed out\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa % 0x100\n\n# same effect, but with a bitwise and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa &amp; 0xff\n\n# extracts the most significant (leftmost) byte of aaaa. The range is inclusive on both sides, and indexed with the rightmost bit being 0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa[31:24]\n\n# concatenates aaaa with itself\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.Concat(aaaa)\n\n# zero-extends aaaa by 32 bits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.zero_extend(32)\n\n# sign-extends aaaa by 32 bits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.sign_extend(32)\n\n# shifts aaaa right arithmetically by 8 bits (i.e., sign-extended)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa &gt;&gt; 8\n\n# shifts aaaa right logically by 8 bits (i.e., not sign-extended)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.LShR(8)\n\n# reverses aaaa, i.e. reverses the order of the bytes as if stored big-endian and loaded little-endian\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.reversed\n\n# returns a list of expressions, representing the individual *bits* of aaaa (expressions of length 1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.chop()\n\n# same, but for the bytes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.chop(bits=8)\n\n# and the dwords\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print aaaa.chop(bits=16)\n\nMore details on the operations supported by the solver engine are available at the solver engine&#39;s documentation.\nSymbolic Constraints\nSymbolic expressions would be pretty boring on their own. After all, the last few that we created could take any numerical value, as they were completely unconstrained. This makes them uninteresting. To spice things up, SimuVEX has the concept of symbolic constraints. Symbolic constraints represent, aptly, constraints (or restrictions) on symbolic expressions. It might be easier to show you:\n# make a copy of the state so that we don&#39;t screw up the original with our experimentation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s3 = s.copy()\n\n# Let&#39;s read some previously untouched section of memory to get a symbolic expression\n&gt;&gt;&gt; m = s.memory.load(0xbbbb0000, 1)\n\n# We can verify that *any* solution would do\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 30)\n# ... and so on\n\n# Now, let&#39;s add a constraint, forcing m to be less than 10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s3.add_constraints(m &lt; 10)\n\n# We can see the effect of this right away!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s3.se.solution(m, 5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert not s3.se.solution(m, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert not s3.se.solution(m, 30)\n\n# But the constraint does not affect the original state\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.solution(m, 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.solution(m, 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.solution(m, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.se.solution(m, 30)\n\nOne cautionary piece of advice is that the comparison operators (&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=) are unsigned by default. That means that, in the above example, this is the case:\n# This is actually -1\nassert not s3.se.solution(m, 0xff)\n\nIf we want signed comparisons, we need to use the unsigned versions of the operators (SGT, SLT, SGE, SLE).\nIf you&#39;d like to be explicit about your unsigned comparisons, the operators (UGT, ULT, UGE, ULE) are available.\n# Add an unsigned comparison\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s4 = s.copy()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s4.add_constraints(claripy.SLT(m, 10))\n\n# We can see the effect of this right away!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s4.se.solution(m, 0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s4.se.solution(m, 5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert not s4.se.solution(m, 20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s4.se.solution(m, 0xff)\n\nAmazing. Of course, constraints can be arbitrarily complex:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s4.add_constraints(claripy.And(claripy.UGT(m, 10), claripy.Or(claripy.ULE(m, 100), m % 200 != 123, claripy.LShR(m, 8) &amp; 0xff != 0xa)))\n\nThere&#39;s a lot there, but, basically, m has to be greater than 10 and either has to be less than 100, or has to be 123 when modded with 200, or, when logically shifted right by 8, the least significant byte must be 0x0a.\nState Options\nThere are a lot of little tweaks that can be made to the internals of simuvex that will optimize behavior in some situations and be a detriment in others. These tweaks are controlled through state options.\nOn each SimState object, there is a set (state.options) of all its enabled options. The full domain of options, along with the defaults for different state types, can be found in (s_options.py)[https://github.com/angr/simuvex/blob/master/simuvex/s_options.py], available as simuvex.o.\nWhen creating a SimState through any method, you may pass the keyword arguments add_options and remove_options, which should be sets of options that modify the initial options set from the default.\n# Example: enable lazy solves, a behavior that causes state satisfiability to be checked as infrequently as possible.\n# This change to the settings will be propogated to all successor states created from this state after this line.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.options.add(simuvex.o.LAZY_SOLVES)\n\n# Create a new state with lazy solves enabled\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s9 = b.factory.entry_state(add_options={simuvex.o.LAZY_SOLVES})\n\n"},"docs/symbolic.html":{"url":"docs/symbolic.html","title":"シンボリック実行","body":"Symbolic Execution\nSymbolic execution allows at a time T to determine for a branch all conditions\nnecessary to take the branch or not.

SimuVEX provides a semantic understanding of what a given piece of VEX code does on a given machine state.\nIn a nutshell, SimuVEX is a symbolic VEX emulator.\nGiven a machine state and a VEX IR block, SimuVEX provides a resulting machine state (or, in the case of condition jumps, several resulting machine states).\nSemantic Translation\nSimuVEX&#39;s ultimate goal is to provide a semantic meaning to blocks of binary code.\nWhile the IR gives us syntactic meaning (i.e., what statements the block contains), SimuVEX can provide us semantic meaning (i.e., what the block does to a given state).\nWe&#39;ll now move on to how to do that.\nAccessing SimIRSBs\nWe get semantic meaning by converting an IRSB into a SimIRSB.\nWhile the former focuses on providing a cross-architecture, programmatically-accessible representation of what a block is, the latter provides a cross-platform, programmatically-accessible representation of what a block did, given an input state.\nNote that you will almost never need to interact with SimIRSBs directly. The higher level angr interfaces complete abstract away simuvex&#39;s pedantic execution model, but it&#39;s important to understand the way that execution happens.\nTo create a SimIRSB directly, use the sim_block(state) constructor in the project factory. Here&#39;s an example.\n# This creates a symbolic state with execution starting at 0x400664,\n# and then symbolically executes the IRSB at its instruction pointer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr, simuvex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;examples/fauxware/fauxware&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; state = b.factory.blank_state(addr=0x400664)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sirsb = b.factory.sim_block(state)\n\n# this is the address of the first instruction in the block\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert sirsb.addr == 0x400664\n\nWhat happened?\nSymbolic execution happened! sirsb is now a record of what happened during the symbolic execution of this basic block. This information is exposed in the form of SimActions. In case you hadn&#39;t noticed, everything that comes out of simuvex has &quot;Sim-&quot; on the front of its name.\nAn IRSB has Statements, so a SimIRSB has SimStatements. Each statement has a list of SimActions recording each of its reads and writes to and from memory, registers, and temps.\nA SimAction has an associated type (i.e., &quot;mem&quot; for memory, &quot;reg&quot; for registers, &quot;tmp&quot; for temps), and action (&quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot;).\n# Print out all the actions for this block:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for sstmt in sirsb.statements:\n...     print &#39;[+] Actions for statement %d&#39; % sstmt.stmt_idx\n...     for a in sstmt.actions:\n...         if a.type == &#39;mem&#39;:\n...             print &quot;Memory write to&quot;, a.addr.ast\n...             print &quot;... address depends on registers&quot;, a.addr.reg_deps, &quot;and temps&quot;, a.addr.tmp_deps\n...             print &quot;... data is:&quot;, a.data.ast\n...             print &quot;... data depends on registers&quot;, a.data.reg_deps, &quot;and temps&quot;, a.data.tmp_deps\n...             if a.condition is not None:\n...                 print &quot;... condition is:&quot;, a.condition.ast\n...             if a.fallback is not None:\n...                 print &quot;... alternate write in case of condition fail:&quot;, a.fallback.ast\n...         elif a.type == &#39;reg&#39;:\n...             print &#39;Register write to registerfile offset&#39;, a.offset\n...             print &quot;... data is:&quot;, a.data.ast\n...         elif a.type == &#39;tmp&#39;:\n...             print &#39;Tmp write to tmp&#39;, a.tmp\n...             print &quot;... data is:&quot;, a.data.ast\n\nWhere are we going?\nFor each Exit in the IRSB, there will be a new successor SimState! Each successor will be a copy of the original state you started with, plus the modifications described by the SimActions, plus the constraints added to the solver engine by the exit you&#39;ve taken. For boring jump exits, no constraints are added, but for conditional jumps, the successor that took the jump gets the guard condition of the jump exit, while the default successor gets the negation.\n# The list of successors:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for succ in sirsb.all_successors:\n...     print succ\n\n# The default successor, i.e. the one that runs off the end of the block:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print sirsb.default_exit\n\n# Any unconstrained successors, that is, successors with symbolic instruction pointers:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for succ in sirsb.unconstrained_successors:\n...     print succ\n\n# Any successors whose constraints contain a contradition (not necessarily a complete list):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for succ in sirsb.unsat_successors:\n...     print succ\n\nSimProcedures\nFun fact: SimIRSBs aren&#39;t the only way to step symbolic execution forward! SimIRSBs inherit the SimRun class, which is a generic class for describing execution steps.\nAt the moment, the only other important SimRun is the SimProcedure. SimProcedures are, first and foremost, symbolic function summaries: angr handles functions imported into the binary by executing a SimProcedure that symbolically implements the given library function, if one exists. SimProcedures are a generic enough interface to do more than this, though - they can be used to run Python code to mutate a state at any point in execution.\nSimProcedures are injected into angr&#39;s execution pipeline through an interface called hooking. The full interface is described here, but the most important part is the Project.hook(address, procedure) method. After running this, whenever execution in this project reaches address, instead of running the SimIRSB at that address, we run the SimProcedure specified by the procedure argument.\nProject.hook can also take a plain python function as an argument, instead of a SimProcedure class. That function will be automatically wrapped by a SimProcedure and executed (with the current SimState) as its argument.\nNobody actually calls Project.factory.sim_block, like in the example above. Instead, use Project.factory.sim_run, which has the exact same interface but will chose what kind of SimRun to create. Again, this is still a very low-level interface that you normally shouldn&#39;t have to touch while writing analyses with angr.\nTODO: Programming SimProcedures. Cover all the kinds of control flow, inline calls, etc. If you want to program a SimProcedure now, look at the library of already-written ones.\nPutting it all together\nNow you have all the components necessary to do the most basic symbolic execution with angr! The below code will execute all possible paths through a binary.\n# Note: please don&#39;t actually do this. This will eat up all your computer&#39;s RAM and you will die.\n# Also there&#39;s no error handling at all!\n\nstates = [b.factory.entry_state()]\nwhile len(states) &gt; 0:\n    successors = []\n    for state in states:\n        successors.extend(b.factory.sim_run(state).all_successors)\n    states = successors\n\nBreakpoints!\nLike any decent execution engine, SimuVEX supports breakpoints. This is pretty cool! A point is set as follows:\n# get our state\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b.factory.entry_state()\n\n# add a breakpoint. This breakpoint will drop into ipdb right before a memory write happens.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.inspect.b(&#39;mem_write&#39;)\n\n# on the other hand, we can have a breakpoint trigger right *after* a memory write happens. On top of that, we\n# can have a specific function get run instead of going straight to ipdb.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def debug_func(state):\n...     print &quot;State %s is about to do a memory write!&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.inspect.b(&#39;mem_write&#39;, when=simuvex.BP_AFTER, action=debug_func)\n\n# or, you can have it drop you in an embedded ipython!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.inspect.b(&#39;mem_write&#39;, when=simuvex.BP_AFTER, action=&#39;ipython&#39;)\n\nThere are many other places to break than a memory write.

In fact, we can even specify a function as a condition:\n# this is a complex condition that could do anything!

Paths are angr&#39;s primary interface to provide an abstraction to control execution, and are used in most interactions with angr and its analyses.\nA path through a program is, at its core, a sequence of basic blocks (actually, SimRuns) representing what was executed since the program started.\nThese blocks in the paths can repeat (in the case of loops) and a program can have a near-infinite amount of paths (for example, a program with a single branch will have two paths, a program with two branches nested within each other will have 4, and so on).\nTo create an empty path at the program&#39;s entry point, do:\n# load a binary\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;/bin/true&#39;)\n\n# load the path\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = b.factory.path()\n\n# this is the address that the path is *about to* execute\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert p.addr == b.entry\n\nAfter this, p is a path representing the program at the entry point.\nWe can see that the callstack and the path&#39;s history are blank:\n# this is the number of basic blocks that have been analyzed by the path\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert p.length == 0\n\n# we can also look at the current backtrace of program execution\n# contains only the dummy frame for execution start\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert len(p.callstack) == 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.callstack\nBacktrace:\nFunc 0x401410, sp=0x7fffffffffeffd8, ret=0x0\n\nMoving Forward\nOf course, we can&#39;t be stuck at the entry point forever. call p.step() to run the single block of symbolic execution.\nWe can look at the successors of a path to see where the program goes after this point. p.step() also returns the successors if you&#39;d like to chain calls.\nMost of the time, a path will have one or two successors. When there are two successors, it usually means the program branched and there are two possible ways forward with execution. Other times, it will have more than two, such as in the case of a jump table.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p.step()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;The path has&quot;, len(p.successors), &quot;successors!&quot;\n\n# each successor is a path, keeping track of an execution history\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = p.successors[0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.addr_trace[-1] == p.addr\n\n# and, of course, we can drill down further!\n# alternate syntax: s.step() returns the same list as s.successors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ss = s.step()[0].step()[0].step()[0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; len(ss.addr_trace.hardcopy) == 4\n\nTo efficiently store information about path histories, angr employs a tree structure that resembles the actual symbolic execution tree.\nYou should never have to worry about this, since through the magic of python we provide efficient accessors for information stored in the tree as it pertains to each stored historical property.\nThe one thing you have to know is that this data structure doesn&#39;t allow efficient iteration through the historical lists in forward order - only in reverse order, from most recent to oldest.\nIf you need to iterate or access items from these sequences starting from the beginning, you may access the .hardcopy property on them, which will extract the entirety of the property&#39;s history as a flat list for you to peruse at leisure.\nFor example: part of the history of a path is the types of jumps that occur.\nThese are stored (as strings representing VEX exit type enums), in the jumpkinds attribute.\n# recall: s is the path created when we stepped forward the initial path once\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.jumpkinds\n&lt;angr.path.JumpkindIter object at 0x7f8161e584d0&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert s.jumpkinds[-1] == &#39;Ijk_Call&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.jumpkinds.hardcopy\n[&#39;Ijk_Call&#39;]\n\n# Don&#39;t do this! This will throw an exception\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # for jk in ss.jumpkinds: print jk\n\n# Do this instead:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for jk in reversed(ss.jumpkinds): print jk\nIjk_Call\nIjk_Call\nIjk_Boring\nIjk_Call\n\n# Or, if you really need to iterate in forward order:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for jk in ss.jumpkinds.hardcopy: print jk\nIjk_Call\nIjk_Boring\nIjk_Call\nIjk_Call\n\nHere is a list of the properties in the path history:\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPath.addr_trace\nThe addresses of basic blocks that have been executed so far, as integers\n\n\nPath.trace\nThe SimRun objects that have been executed so far, as strings\n\n\nPath.targets\nThe targets of the jumps/successors that have been taken so far\n\n\nPath.guards\nThe guard conditions that had to be satisfied in order to take the branch listed in Path.targets\n\n\nPath.jumpkinds\nThe type of the exit from each basic block we took, as VEX struct strings\n\n\nPath.events\nA log of the events that have happened in symbolic execution\n\n\nPath.actions\nA filtering of Path.events to only include the actions taken by the exeution engine. See below.\n\n\n\nHere are the different types of jumpkinds:\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIjk_Boring\nA normal jump to an address.\n\n\nIjk_Call\nA call to an address.\n\n\nIjk_Ret\nA return.\n\n\nIjk_Sig*\nVarious signals.\n\n\nIjk_Sys*\nSystem calls.\n\n\nIjk_NoHook\nA jump out of an angr hook.\n\n\n\nMerging Paths\nLike states, paths can be merged.\nTruly understanding this requires concepts that will be explained in future sections, but in a nutshell, we can combine two paths that reached the same program point in different ways.\nFor example, let&#39;s say that we have a branch:\n# step until branch\np = b.factory.path()\np.step()\nwhile len(p.successors) == 1:\n    print &#39;step&#39;\n    p = p.successors[0]\n    p.step()\n\nprint p\nbranched_left = p.successors[0]\nbranched_right = p.successors[1]\nassert branched_left.addr != branched_right.addr\n\n# Step the branches until they converge again\nafter_branched_left = branched_left.step()[0]\nafter_branched_right = branched_right.step()[0]\nassert after_branched_left.addr == after_branched_right.addr\n\n# this will merge both branches into a single path. Values in memory and registers\n# will hold any possible values they could have held in either path.\nmerged = after_branched_left.merge(after_branched_right)\nassert merged.addr == after_branched_left.addr and merged.addr == after_branched_right.addr\n\nPaths can also be unmerged later.\nmerged_successor = merged.step()[0].step()[0]\nunmerged_paths = merged_successor.unmerge()\n\nassert len(unmerged_paths) == 2\nassert unmerged_paths[0].addr == unmerged_paths[1].addr\n\nNon-entry point start\nSometimes, you might want to start the analysis of a program partway through the program.\nFor example, you might be interested in what a specific part of a function does, but don&#39;t know how to (or don&#39;t want to) guide a path to that point.\nTo handle this, we allow the creation of a path at any point in the program:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; st = b.factory.blank_state(addr=0x800f000)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = b.factory.path(st)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert p.addr == 0x800f000\n\nAt this point, all memory, registers, and so forth of the path are blank. In a nutshell, this means that they are fully symbolic and unconstrained, and execution can procede from this point as an overapproximation of what could happen on a real CPU. If you have outside knowledge about what the state should look like at this point, you can craft the blank state into a more precise description of machine state by adding constraints and setting the contents of memory, registers, and files.\nSimActions Redux\nThe SimActions from deep within simuvex are exported for much easier access through the Path. Actions are part of the path&#39;s history (Path.actions), so the same rules as the other history items about iterating over them still apply. The actions are a flat list here, instead of the per-statement way they&#39;re present in SimIRSBs.\nWhen paths grow long, stored SimActions can be a serious source of memory consumption. Because of this, by default all but the most recent SimActions are discarded. To disable this behavior, enable the TRACK_ACTION_HISTORY state option.\nThere is a convenient interface for filtering through a potentially huge list of actions to find a specific write or read operation. Take a look at the api documentation for Path.filter_actions.\n"},"docs/pathgroups.html":{"url":"docs/pathgroups.html","title":"バルク実行 - パスグループ","body":"Bulk Execution and Exploration - Path Groups\nPath groups are just a bunch of paths being executed at once. They are also the future.\nPath groups let you wrangle multiple paths in a slick way.\nPaths are organized into “stashes”, which you can step forward, filter, merge,\nand move around as you wish. There are different kind of stashes, which are\nspecified in Paths. This allows you to, for example,\nstep two different stashes of paths at different rates, then merge them together.\nHere are some basic examples of pathgroups capabilities:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = angr.Project(&#39;examples/fauxware/fauxware&#39;, load_options={&#39;auto_load_libs&#39;: False})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pg = p.factory.path_group()\n\nExploring a path:\n# While there are active path, we step\n&gt;&gt;&gt; while len(pg.active) &gt; 0:\n...    pg.step()\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(pg)\n&lt;PathGroup with 1 deadended&gt;\n\nWe now have a deadended path, let&#39;s see what we can do with it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; path = pg.deadended[0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;Path length: {0} steps&#39;.format(path.length))\nPath length: 50 steps\n\nGet path trace:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;Trace:&#39;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for step in path.trace:\n...    print(step)\nTrace:\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400580&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400540&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure __libc_start_main&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007e0&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4004e0&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4005ac&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4005be&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4004e9&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400640&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400660&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4004ee&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400880&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4008af&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4004f3&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400825&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400846&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure __libc_start_main&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x40071d&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400510&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure puts&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x40073e&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400530&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure read&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400754&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400530&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure read&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x40076a&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400510&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure puts&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400774&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400530&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure read&gt;\nimIRSB 0x40078a&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400530&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure read&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007a0&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400664&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400550&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure strcmp&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x40068e&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400692&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4006eb&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007b3&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007bd&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4006ed&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x400510&gt;\n&lt;SimProcedure puts&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4006fb&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007c7&gt;\n&lt;SimIRSB 0x4007d3&gt;\n\nGet constraints applied to the path:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;There are %d constraints.&#39; % len(path.state.se.constraints))\nThere are 2 constraints.\n\nGet memory state at the end of the traversal:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;rax: {0}&#39;.format(path.state.regs.rax))\nrax: &lt;BV64 0x37&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; assert path.state.se.any_int(path.state.regs.rip) == path.addr  # regs are BitVectors\n\nPathGroup.Explorer()\nPathgroups are supposed to replace surveyors.Explorer, being more clever and\nefficient. When launching path_group.Explore with a find argument, multiple\npaths will be launched and step until one of them finds one of the address we\nare looking for. Paths reaching the avoided addresses, if any, will be put\ninto the avoided stash. If an active path reaches an interesting address, it\nwill be stashed into the found stash, and the other ones will remain active.\nYou can then explore the found path, or decide to discard it and continue with\nthe other ones.\nLet&#39;s look at a simple crackme example:\nFirst, we load the binary.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = angr.Project(&#39;examples/CSCI-4968-MBE/challenges/crackme0x00a/crackme0x00a&#39;)\n\nNext, we create a path group.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pg = p.factory.path_group()\n\nNow, we symbolically execute until we find a path that matches our condition (i.e., the &quot;win&quot; condition).\n&gt;&gt; pg.explore(find=lambda p: &quot;Congrats&quot; in p.state.posix.dumps(1))\n&lt;PathGroup with 1 active, 1 found&gt;\n\nNow, we can get the flag out of that state!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = pg.found[0].state\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.posix.dumps(1)\nEnter password: Congrats!\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; flag = s.posix.dumps(0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(flag)\ng00dJ0B!\nPretty simple, isn&#39;t it?\nOther examples can be found by browsing the examples.\nTODO: STASHES\nStash types\nPaths are put into different stashes during a PathGroup&#39;s execution.\nThese are:\n\n\n\nStash\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactive\nThis stash contains the paths that will be stepped by default (unless an alternate stash is specified for path_group.step().\n\n\ndeadended\nA path goes to the deadended stash when it cannot continue the execution for some reason, including no more valid instructions, unsat state of all of its successors, or an invalid instruction pointer.\n\n\nfound\nA path goes to the found stash when the path group determines that it matches the condition passed to the find argument of path_group.explore.\n\n\navoided\nA path goes to the avoided stash when the path group determines that it matches the condition passed to the avoid argument of path_group.explore.\n\n\npruned\nWhen using LAZY_SOLVES, paths are not checked for satisfiability unless absolutely necessary. When a state is found to be unsat in the presence of LAZY_SOLVES, the path hierarchy is traversed to identify when, in its history, it initially became unsat. All paths that are descendent from that point (which will also be unsat, since a state cannot become un-unsat) are pruned and put in this stash.\n\n\nerrored\nPaths are put in this stash when they cause a Python exception to be raised during execution. This implies a bug in angr or in your custom code (if any).\n\n\nunconstrained\nIf the save_unconstrained option is provided to the PathGroup constructor, paths that are determined to be unconstrained (i.e., with the instruction pointer controlled by user data or some other source of symbolic data) are placed here.\n\n\nunsat\nIf the save_unsat option is provided to the PathGroup constructor, paths that are determined to be unsatisfiable (i.e., they have constraints that are contradictory, like the input having to be both &quot;AAAA&quot; and &quot;BBBB&quot; at the same time) are placed here.\n\n\n\nYou can move paths between stashes by using the path_group.move function.\nThis function accepts many options to control which paths are moved between which stashes.\n"},"docs/surveyors.html":{"url":"docs/surveyors.html","title":"バルク実行 - サーベイヤー","body":"Symbolic Execution - Surveyors\nAt heart, angr is a symbolic execution engine.\nangr exposes a standard way to write and perform dynamic symbolic execution: the Surveyor class.\nA Surveyor is the engine that drives symbolic execution: it tracks what paths are active, identifies which paths to step forward and which paths to prune, and optimizes resource allocation.\n/!\\ Surveyors are an old API that is rather unweildy. It&#39;s recommended to use PathGroups instead. /!\\\nThe Surveyor class is not meant to be used directly.\nRather, it should be subclassed by developers to implement their own analyses.\nThat being said, the most common symbolic analysis (i.e., &quot;explore from A to B, trying to avoid C&quot;) has already been implemented in the Explorer class.\nExplorer\nangr.surveyors.Explorer is a Surveyor subclass that implements symbolic exploration.\nIt can be told where to start, where to go, what to avoid, and what paths to stick to.\nIt also tries to avoid getting stuck in loops.\nIn the end, one cannot be told what the Explorer is.\nYou have to see it for yourself:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;examples/fauxware/fauxware&#39;)\n\n# By default, a Surveyor starts at the entry point of the program, with\n# an exit created by calling `Project.initial_exit` with default arguments.\n# This involves creating a default state using `Project.initial_state`.\n# A custom SimExit, with a custom state, can be provided via the optional\n# &quot;start&quot; parameter, or a list of them via the optional &quot;starts&quot; parameter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e = b.surveyors.Explorer()\n\n# Now we can take a few steps! Printing an Explorer will tell you how\n# many active paths it currently has.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print e.step()\n\n# You can use `Explorer.run` to step multiple times.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print e.run(10)\n\n# Or even forever. By default, an Explorer will not stop running until\n# it runs out of paths (which will likely be never, for most programs),\n# so be careful. In this case, we should be ok because the program does\n# not loop.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e.run()\n\n# We can see which paths are active (running), and which have deadended\n# (i.e., provided no valid exits), and which have errored out. Note that,\n# in some instances, a given path could be in multiple lists (i.e., if it\n# errored out *and* did not produce any valid exits)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;%d paths are still running&quot; % len(e.active)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;%d paths are backgrounded due to lack of resources&quot; % len(e.spilled)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;%d paths are suspended due to user action&quot; % len(e.suspended)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;%d paths had errors&quot; % len(e.errored)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;%d paths deadended&quot; % len(e.deadended)\n\nSo far, everything we have discussed applies to all Surveyors.\nHowever, the nice thing about an Explorer is that you can tell it to search for, or avoid certain blocks.\nFor example, in the fauxware sample, we can try to find the &quot;authentication success&quot; function while avoiding the &quot;authentication failed&quot; function.\n# This creates an Explorer that tries to find 0x4006ed (successful auth),\n# while avoiding 0x4006fd (failed auth) or 0x4006aa (the authentication\n# routine). In essense, we are looking for a backdoor.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e = b.surveyors.Explorer(find=(0x4006ed,), avoid=(0x4006aa,0x4006fd))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e.run()\n\n# Print our found backdoor, and how many paths we avoided!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; if len(e.found) &gt; 0:\n...     print &quot;Found backdoor path:&quot;, e.found[0]\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Avoided %d paths&quot; % len(e.avoided)\n\nSome helper properties are provided for easier access to paths from ipython:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;The first found path is&quot;, e._f\n# Also available are _d (deadended), _spl (spilled), and _e (errored)\n\nCaller\nThe Caller is a surveyor that handles calling functions to make it easier to figure out what the heck they do.\nIt can be used as so:\n# load fauxware\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;examples/fauxware/fauxware&#39;)\n\n# get the state ready, and grab our username and password symbolic expressions for later\n# checking. Here, we&#39;ll cheat a bit since we know that username and password should both\n# be 8 chars long\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = b.factory.path()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; username = p.state.memory.load(0x1000, 9)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; password = p.state.memory.load(0x2000, 9)\n\n# call the authenticate function with *username being 0x1000 and *password being 0x2000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = b.surveyors.Caller(0x400664, (0x1000,0x2000), start=p)\n\n# look at the different paths that can return. This should print 3 paths:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print tuple(c.iter_returns())\n\n# two of those paths return 1 (authenticated):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print tuple(c.iter_returns(solution=1))\n\n# now let&#39;s see the required username and password to reach that point. `c.map_se`\n# calls state.se.any_n_str (or whatever other function is provided) for the provided\n# arguments, on each return state. This example runs state.se.any_n_str(credentials, 10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; credentials = username.concat(password)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(c.map_se(&#39;any_n_str&#39;, credentials, 10, solution=1))\n\n# you can see the secret password &quot;SOSNEAKY&quot; in the first tuple!\n\nCaller is a pretty powerful tool. Check out the comments on the various functions for more usage info! HOWEVER, there is a much easier tool you can use to call functions, called callable. This is described elsewhere in the docs.\nInterrupting Surveyors\nA surveyor saves its internal state after every tick.\nIn ipython, you should be able to interrupt a surveyor with Ctrl-C, and then check what results it has so far, but that&#39;s a pretty ugly way of doing it.\nThere are two official ways of doing this cleanly: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.\nIf you send SIGUSR1 to a python process running a surveyor, it causes the main loop in Surveyor.run() to terminate at the end of the current Surveyor.step().\nYou can then analyze the result.\nTo continue running the surveyor, call angr.surveyor.resume_analyses() (to clear the &quot;signalled&quot; flag) and then call the surveyor&#39;s run() function.\nSince SIGUSR1 causes run() to return, this is rarely useful in a scripted analysis, as the rest of the program will run after run() returns.\nInstead, SIGUSR1 is meant to provide a clean alternative to Ctrl-C.\nSending SIGUSR2 to the python process, on the other hand, causes run() to invoke an ipdb breakpoint after every step().\nThis allows you to debug, then continue your program.\nMake sure to run angr.surveyor.disable_singlestep() before continuing to clear the &quot;signalled&quot; flag.\n"},"docs/structured_data.html":{"url":"docs/structured_data.html","title":"データ型と呼び出し規約を扱う","body":"Working with Data and Conventions\nFrequently, you&#39;ll want to access structured data from the program you&#39;re analyzing.\nangr has several features to make this less of a headache.\nWorking with types\nSimuVEX has a system for representing types.\nThese SimTypes are found in simuvex/s_type.py - an instance of any of these classes represents a type.\nMany of the types are incomplete unless they are supplimented with a SimState - their size depends on the architecture you&#39;re running under.\nYou may do this with ty.with_state(state), which returns a copy of itself, with the state specified.\nSimuVEX also has a light wrapper around pycparser, which is a C parser.\nThis helps with getting instances of type objects:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

Any type may support any refinement it likes.\nRight now the only refinements supported are that you may access any member of a struct by its member name, and you may index into a string or array to access that element.\nIf the address you specified initially points to an array of that type, you can say .array(n) to view the data as an array of n elements.\nFinally, extract the structured data with .resolved or .concrete.\n.resolved will return bitvector values, while .concrete will return integer, string, array, etc values, whatever best represents the data.\nAlternately, you may store a value to memory, by assigning to the chain of properties that you&#39;ve constructed.\nNote that because of the way python works, x = s.mem[...].prop; x = val will NOT work, you must say s.mem[...].prop = val.\n\nIf you define a struct using s_type.define_struct, you can access it here as a type:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.mem[b.entry].abcd\n&lt;struct abcd {\n  .x = &lt;int (32 bits) &lt;BV32 0x8949ed31&gt; at 0x400580&gt;,\n  .y = &lt;int (32 bits) &lt;BV32 0x89485ed1&gt; at 0x400584&gt;\n} at 0x400580&gt;\n\nWorking with Calling Conventions\nA calling convention is the specific means by which code passes arguments and return values through function calls.\nWhile angr comes with a large number of pre-built calling conventions, and a lot of logic for refining calling conventions for specifc circumstances (e.g. floating point arguments need to be stored in different locations, it gets worse from there), it will inevitably be insufficient to describe all possible calling conventions a compiler could generate.\nBecause of this, you can customize a calling convention by describing where the arguments and return values should live.\nangr&#39;s abstraction of calling conventions lives in Simuvex as SimCC.\nYou can construct new SimCC instances through the angr object factory, with b.factory.cc(...).\n\nPass as the args keyword argument a list of argument storage locations\nPass as the ret_val keyword argument the location where the return value should be stored\nPass as the func_ty keyword argument a SymType for the function prototype.\nPass it none of these things to use a sane default for the current architecture!\n\nTo specify a value location for the args or ret_val parameters, use instances of the SimRegArg or SimStackArg classes.\nYou can find them in the factory - b.factory.cc.Sim*Arg.\nRegister arguments should be instanciated with the name of the register you&#39;re storing the value in, and the size of the register in bytes.\nStack arguments should be instanciated with the offset from the stack pointer at the time of entry into the function and the size of the storage location, in bytes.\nOnce you have a SimCC object, you can use it along with a SimState object to extract or store function arguments more cleanly.\nTake a look at the API documentation for details.\nAlternately, you can pass it to an interface that can use it to modify its own behavior, like b.factory.call_state, or...\nCallables\nCallables are a Foreign Functions Interface (FFI) for symbolic execution.\nBasic callable usage is to create one with myfunc = b.factory.callable(addr), and then call it! result = myfunc(args, ...)\nWhen you call the callable, angr will set up a call_state at the given address, dump the given arguments into memory, and run a path_group based on this state until all the paths have exited from the function.\nThen, it merges all the result states together, pulls the return value out of that state, and returns it.\nAll the interaction with the state happens with the aid of a SimCC, to tell where to put the arguments and where to get the return value.\nBy default, it uses a sane default for the archetecture, but if you&#39;d like to customize it, you can pass a SimCC object in the cc keyword argument when constructing the callable.\nYou can pass symbolic data as function arguments, and everything will work fine.\nYou can even pass more complicated data, like strings, lists, and structures as native python data (use tuples for structures), and it&#39;ll be serialized as cleanly as possible into the state.\nIf you&#39;d like to specify a pointer to a certain value, you can wrap it in a PointerWrapper object, available as b.factory.callable.PointerWrapper.\nThe exact semantics of how pointer-wrapping work are a little confusing, but they can be boiled down to &quot;unless you specify it with a PointerWrapper or a specific SimArrayType, nothing will be wrapped in a pointer automatically unless it gets to the end and it hasn&#39;t yet been wrapped in a pointer yet and the original type is a string, array, or tuple.&quot;\nThe relevant code is actually in SimCC - it&#39;s the setup_callsite function.\nIf you don&#39;t care for the actual return value of the call, you can say func.perform_call(arg, ...), and then the properties func.result_state and func.result_path_group will be populated.\nThey will actually be populated even if you call the callable normally, but you probably care about them more in this case!\n"},"docs/analyses.html":{"url":"docs/analyses.html","title":"解析","body":"Analyses\nangr&#39;s goal is to make it easy to carry out useful analyses on binary programs.\nThis section will discuss how to run and create these analyses.\nBuilt-in Analyses\nangr comes with several built-in analyses:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCFGFast\nConstructs a fast Control Flow Graph of the program. b.analyses.CFG() is what you want.\n\n\nCFGAccurate\nConstructs an accurate Control Flow Graph of the program.

For example, b.analyses.FuncSize().\nIf you&#39;ve registered a new analysis since loading the project, refresh the list of registered analyses on your project with b.analyses.reload_analyses().\nAnalysis Resilience\nSometimes, your (or our) code might suck and analyses might throw exceptions.\nWe understand, and we also understand that oftentimes a partial result is better than nothing.\nThis is specifically true when, for example, running an analysis on all of the functions in a program.\nEven if some of the functions fails, we still want to know the results of the functions that do not.\nTo facilitate this, the Analysis base class provides a resilience context manager under self._resilience.\nHere&#39;s an example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class ComplexFunctionAnalysis(angr.Analysis):\n...     def __init__(self):\n...         self._cfg = self.project.analyses.CFG()\n...         self.results = { }\n...         for addr, func in self._cfg.function_manager.functions.iteritems():\n...             with self._resilience():\n...                 if addr % 2 == 0:\n...                     raise ValueError(&quot;can&#39;t handle functions at even addresses&quot;)\n...                 else:\n...                     self.results[addr] = &quot;GOOD&quot;\n\nThe context manager catches any exceptions thrown and logs them (as a tuple of the exception type, message, and traceback) to self.errors.\nThese are also saved and loaded when the analysis is saved and loaded (although the traceback is discarded, as it is not picklable).\nYou can tune the effects of the resilience with two optional keyword parameters to self._resilience().\nThe first is name, which affects where the error is logged.\nBy default, errors are placed in self.errors, but if name is provided, then instead the error is logged to self.named_errors, which is a dict mapping name to a list of all the errors that were caught under that name.\nThis allows you to easily tell where thrown without examining its traceback.\nThe second argument is exception, which should be the type of the exception that _resilience should catch.\nThis defaults to Exception, which handles (and logs) almost anything that could go wrong.\nYou can also pass a tuple of exception types to this option, in which case all of them will be caught.\nUsing _resilience has a few advantages:\n\nYour exceptions are gracefully logged and easily accessible afterwards. This is really nice for writing testcases.\nWhen creating your analysis, the user can pass fail_fast=True, which transparently disable the resilience, which is really nice for manual testing.\nIt&#39;s prettier than having try/except everywhere.\n\nHave fun with analyses! Once you master the rest of angr, you can use analyses to understand anything computable!\n"},"docs/analyses/cfg_accurate.html":{"url":"docs/analyses/cfg_accurate.html","title":"CFGAccurate","body":"CFGAccurate\nHere we describe angr’s CFGAccurate analysis in details, as well as some important concepts like context sensitivity and Function Manager of angr.\nGeneral ideas\nA basic analysis that one might carry out on a binary is a Control Flow Graph.\nA CFG is a graph with (conceptually) basic blocks as nodes and jumps/calls/rets/etc as edges.\nIn angr, there are two types of CFG that can be generated: a fast CFG (CFGFast) and an accurate CFG (CFGAccurate).\nAs their names suggested, generating a fast CFG is usually much faster than generating the accurate one.\nIn general, CFGFast is what you need.\nThis page discusses CFGAccurate.\nAn accurate CFG can be constructed by doing:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import angr\n# load your project\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = angr.Project(&#39;/bin/true&#39;, load_options={&#39;auto_load_libs&#39;: False})\n\n# generate an accurate CFG\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cfg = b.analyses.CFGAccurate(keep_state=True)\n\nOf course, there are several options for customized CFGs.\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncontext_sensitivity_level\nThis sets the context sensitivity level of the analysis. See the context sensitivity level section below for more information. This is 1 by default.\n\n\nstarts\nA list of addresses, to use as entry points into the analysis.\n\n\navoid_runs\nA list of addresses to ignore in the analysis.\n\n\ncall_depth\nLimit the depth of the analysis to some number calls. This is useful for checking which functions a specific function can directly jump to (by setting call_depth to 1).\n\n\ninitial_state\nAn initial state can be provided to the CFG, which it will use throughout its analysis.\n\n\nkeep_state\nTo save memory, the state at each basic block is discarded by default. If keep_state is True, the state is saved in the CFGNode.\n\n\nenable_symbolic_back_traversal\nWhether to enable an intensive technique for resolving indirect jumps\n\n\nenable_advanced_backward_slicing\nWhether to enable another intensive technique for resolving direct jumps\n\n\nmore!\nExamine the docstring on b.analyses.CFGAccurate for more up-to-date options\n\n\n\nContext Sensitivity Level\nangr constructs a CFG by executing every basic block and seeing where it goes.\nThis introduces some challenges: a basic block can act differently in different contexts.\nFor example, if a block ends in a function return, the target of that return will be different, depending on different callers of the function containing that basic block.\nThe context sensitivity level is, conceptually, the number of such callers to keep on the callstack.\nTo explain this concept, let&#39;s look at the following code:\nvoid error(char *error)\n{\n    puts(error);\n}\n\nvoid alpha()\n{\n    puts(&quot;alpha&quot;);\n    error(&quot;alpha!&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid beta()\n{\n    puts(&quot;beta&quot;);\n    error(&quot;beta!&quot;);\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    alpha();\n    beta();\n}\n\nThe above sample has four call chains: main&gt;alpha&gt;puts, main&gt;alpha&gt;error&gt;puts and main&gt;beta&gt;puts, and main&gt;beta&gt;error&gt;puts.\nWhile, in this case, angr can probably execute both call chains, this becomes unfeasible for larger binaries.\nThus, angr executes the blocks with states limited by the context sensitivity level.\nThat is, each function is re-analyzed for each unique context that it is called in.\nFor example, the puts() function above will be analyzed with the following contexts, given different context sensitivity levels:\n\n\n\nLevel\nMeaning\nContexts\n\n\n\n\n0\nCallee-only\nputs\n\n\n1\nOne caller, plus callee\nalpha&gt;puts beta&gt;puts error&gt;puts\n\n\n2\nTwo callers, plus callee\nalpha&gt;error&gt;puts main&gt;alpha&gt;puts beta&gt;error&gt;puts main&gt;beta&gt;puts\n\n\n3\nThree callers, plus callee\nmain&gt;alpha&gt;error&gt;puts main&gt;alpha&gt;puts main&gt;beta&gt;error&gt;puts main&gt;beta&gt;puts\n\n\n\nThe upside of increasing the context sensitivity level is that more information can be gleamed from the CFG.\nFor example, with context sensitivity of 1, the CFG will show that, when called from alpha, puts returns to alpha, when called from error, puts returns to error, and so forth.\nWith context sensitivity of 0, the CFG simply shows that puts returns to alpha, beta, and error.\nThis, specifically, is the context sensitivity level used in IDA.\nThe downside of increasing the context sensitivity level is that it exponentially increases the analysis time.\nUsing the CFG\nThe CFG, at its core, is a NetworkX di-graph.\nThis means that all of the normal NetworkX APIs are available:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;This is the graph:&quot;, cfg.graph\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;It has %d nodes and %d edges&quot; % (len(cfg.graph.nodes()), len(cfg.graph.edges()))\n\nThe nodes of the CFG graph are instances of class CFGNode.\nDue to context sensitivity, a given basic block can have multiple nodes in the graph (for multiple contexts).\n# this grabs *any* node at a given location:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; entry_node = cfg.get_any_node(b.entry)\n\n# on the other hand, this grabs all of the nodes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;There were %d contexts for the entry block&quot; % len(cfg.get_all_nodes(b.entry))\n\n# if keep_state was given as True, we can also retrieve the actual SimIRSBs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;A single SimIRSB at the entry point:&quot;, cfg.get_any_irsb(b.entry)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;All SimIRSBs at the entry point:&quot;, cfg.get_all_irsbs(b.entry)\n\n# we can also look up predecessors and successors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Predecessors of the entry point:&quot;, entry_node.predecessors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Successors of the entry point:&quot;, entry_node.successors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Successors (and type of jump) of the entry point:&quot;, [ jumpkind + &quot; to &quot; + str(node.addr) for node,jumpkind in cfg.get_successors_and_jumpkind(entry_node) ]\n\nViewing the CFG\nControl-flow graph rendering is a hard problem.\nangr does not provide any built-in mechanism for rendering the output of a CFG analysis, and attempting to use a traditional graph rendering library, like matplotlib, will result in an unusable image.\nOne solution for viewing angr CFGs is found in axt&#39;s angr-utils repository.\nShared Libraries\nThe CFG analysis does not distinguish between code from different binary objects.\nThis means that by default, it will try to analyze control flow through loaded shared libraries.\nThis is almost never intended behavior, since this will extend the analysis time to several days, probably.\nTo load a binary without shared libraries, add the following keyword argument to the Project constructor:\nload_options={&#39;auto_load_libs&#39;: False}\nFunction Manager\nThe CFG result produces an object called the Function Manager, accessible through cfg.kb.functions.\nThe most common use case for this object is to access it like a dictionnary. It maps addresses to Function objects, which can tell you properties about a function.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; entry_func = cfg.kb.functions[b.entry]\n\nFunctions have several important properties!\n\nentry_func.block_addrs is a set of addresses at which basic blocks belonging to the function begin.\nentry_func.blocks is the set of basic blocks belonging to the function, that you can explore and disassemble using capstone.\nentry_func.string_references() returns a list of all the constant strings that were referred to at any point in the function.\nThey are formatted as (addr, string) tuples, where addr is the address in the binary&#39;s data section the string lives, and string is a python string that contains the value of the string.\nentry_func.returning is a boolean value signifying whether or not the function can return.\nFalse indicates that all paths do not return.\nentry_func.callable is an angr Callable object referring to this function.\nYou can call it like a python function with python arguments and get back an actual result (may be symbolic) as if you ran the function with those arguments!\nentry_func.transition_graph is a NetworkX DiGraph describing control flow within the function itself. It resembles the control-flow graphs IDA displays on a per-function level.\nentry_func.name is the name of the function.\nentry_func.has_unresolved_calls and entry.has_unresolved_jumps have to do with detecting imprecision within the CFG.\nSometimes, the analysis cannot detect what the possible target of an indirect call or jump could be.\nIf this occurs within a function, that function will have the appropriate has_unresolved_* value set to True.\nentry_func.get_call_sites() returns a list of all the addresses of basic blocks which end in calls out to other functions.\nentry_func.get_call_target(callsite_addr) will, given callsite_addr from the list of call site addresses, return where that callsite will call out to.\nentry_func.get_call_return(callsite_addr) will, given callsite_addr from the list of call site addresses, return where that callsite should return to.\n\nand many more !\n"},"docs/analyses/backward_slice.html":{"url":"docs/analyses/backward_slice.html","title":"バックワードスライス","body":"Backward Slicing\nA program slice is a subset of statements that is obtained from the original program, usually by removing zero or more statements.\nSlicing is often helpful in debugging and program understanding.\nFor instance, it’s usually easier to locate the source of a variable on a program slice.\nA backward slice is constructed from a target in the program, and all data flows in this slice end at the target.\nangr has a built-in analysis, called BackwardSlice, to construct a backward program slice.\nThis section will act as a how-to for angr’s BackwardSlice analysis, and followed by some in-depth discussion over the implementation choices and limitations.\nFirst Step First\nTo build a BackwardSlice, you will need the following information as input.\n\nRequired CFG.

If you&#39;re really impatient, ping us about uploading our fork!\nEnable fast memory and fast registers.\nThe state options simuvex.o.FAST_MEMORY and simuvex.o.FAST_REGISTERS will do this.\nThese will switch the memory/registers over to a less intensive memory model that sacrifices accuracy for speed.\nTODO: document the specific sacrifices. Should be safe for mostly concrete access though.\nNOTE: not compatible with concretization strategies.\nConcretize your input ahead of time.\nThis is the approach taken by driller.\nBefore execution begins, we fill state.posix.files[0] with symbolic data representing the input, then constrain that symbolic data to what we want the input to be, then set a concrete file size (state.posix.files[0].size = whatever).\nIf you don&#39;t require any tracking of the data coming from stdin, you can forego the symbolic part and just fill it with concrete data.\nIf there are other sources of input besides standard input, do the same for those.\nUse the afterburner.\nWhile using unicorn, if you add the UNICORN_THRESHOLD_CONCRETIZATION state option, SimuVEX will accept thresholds after which it causes symbolic values to be concretized so that execution can spend more time in Unicorn. Specifically, the following thresholds exist:\n\nstate.se.unicorn.concretization_threshold_memory - this is the number of times a symbolic variable, stored in memory, is allowed to kick execution out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into Unicorn anyways.\nstate.se.unicorn.concretization_threshold_registers - this is the number of times a symbolic variable, stored in a register, is allowed to kick execution out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into Unicorn anyways.\nstate.se.unicorn.concretization_threshold_instruction - this is the number of times that any given instruction can force execution out of Unicorn (by running into symbolic data) before any symbolic data encountered at that instruction is concretized to force execution into Unicorn.\n\nYou can get further control of what is and isn&#39;t concretized with the following sets:\n\nstate.se.unicorn.always_concretize - a set of variable names that will always be concretized to force execution into unicorn (in fact, the memory and register thresholds just end up causing variables to be added to this list).\nstate.se.unicorn.never_concretize - a set of variable names that will never be concretized and forced into Unicorn under any condition.\nstate.se.unicorn.concretize_at - a set of instruction addresses at which data should be concretized and forced into Unicorn. The instruction threshold causes addresses to be added to this set.\n\nOnce something is concretized with the afterburner, you will lose track of that variable.\nThe state will still be consistent, but you&#39;ll lose dependencies, as the stuff that comes out of Unicorn is just concrete bits with no memory of what variables they came from.\nStill, this might be worth it for the speed in some cases, if you know what you want to (or do not want to) concretize.\n\n\n"},"docs/examples.html":{"url":"docs/examples.html","title":"実例","body":"angr examples\nTo help you get started with angr, we&#39;ve created several examples.\nThese mostly stem from CTF problems solved with angr by Shellphish.\nEnjoy!\nIntroduction example - Fauxware\nThis is a basic script that explains how to use angr to symbolically execute a program and produce concrete input satisfying certain conditions.\nBinary, source, and script are found here.\nCTF Problems\nReverseMe example: HackCon 2016 - angry-reverser\nauthor: Stanislas Lejay (github: @P1kachu)\nScript runtime: ~31 minutes\nHere is the binary and the script\nExploitMe example: SecuInside 2016 Quals - mbrainfuzz\nScript author: nsr (nsr@tasteless.eu)\nScript runtime: ~15 seconds per binary\nOriginally, a binary was given to the ctf-player by the challenge-service, and an exploit had to be crafted automatically.

For example,\nangr.analyses.cfg. Because of the way the python logging module works, you\ncan set the verbosity for all submodules in a module by setting a verbosity\nlevel for the parent module. For example, logging.getLogger(&#39;angr.analyses&#39;).setLevel(logging.INFO)\nwill make the CFG, as well as all other analyses, log at the INFO level.\nAutomatic log settings\nIf you&#39;re using angr through ipython, you can add a startup script in your\nipython profile to set various logging levels.\nWhy is a CFG taking forever to construct?\nYou want to load the binary without shared libraries loaded. If they are loaded,\nlike they are by default, the analysis will try to construct a CFG through your\nlibraries, which is almost always a really bad idea. Add the following option\nto your Project constructor call: load_options={&#39;auto_load_libs&#39;: False}\nWhy did you choose VEX instead of another IR (such as LLVM, REIL, BAP, etc)?\nWe had two design goals in angr that influenced this choice:\n\nangr needed to be able to analyze binaries from multiple architectures. This mandated the use of an IR to preserve our sanity, and required the IR to support many architectures.\nWe wanted to implement a binary analysis engine, not a binary lifter. Many projects start and end with the implementation of a lifter, which is a time consuming process. We needed to take something that existed and already supported the lifting of multiple architectures.\n\nSearching around the internet, the major choices were:\n\nLLVM is an obvious first candidate, but lifting binary code to LLVM cleanly is a pain. The two solutions are either lifting to LLVM through QEMU, which is hackish (and the only implementation of it seems very tightly integrated into S2E), or mcsema, which only supports x86.\nTCG is QEMU&#39;s IR, but extracting it seems very daunting as well and documentation is very scarse.\nREIL seems promising, but there is no standard reference implementation that supports all the architectures that we wanted. It seems like a nice academic work, but to use it, we would have to implement our own lifters, which we wanted to avoid.\nBAP was another possibility. When we started work on angr, BAP only supported lifting x86 code, and up-do-date versions of BAP were only available to academic collaborators of the BAP authors. These were two deal-breakers. BAP has since become open, but it still only supports x86_64, x86, and ARM.\nVEX was the only choice that offered an open library and support for many architectures. As a bonus, it is very well documented and designed specifically for program analysis, making it very easy to use in angr.\n\nWhile angr uses VEX now, there&#39;s no fundamental reason that multiple IRs cannot be used. There are two parts of angr, outside of the simuvex.vex package, that are VEX-specific:\n\nthe jump lables (i.e., the Ijk_Ret for returns, Ijk_Call for calls, and so forth) are VEX enums.\nVEX treats registers as a memory space, and so does angr. While we provide accesses to state.regs.rax and friends, on the backend, this does state.registers.load(8, 8), where the first 8 is a VEX-defined offset for rax to the register file.\n\nTo support multiple IRs, we&#39;ll either want to abstract these things or translate their labels to VEX analogues.\nMy load options are ignored when creating a Project.\nCLE options are an optional argument. Make sure you call Project with the following syntax:\nb = angr.Project(&#39;/bin/true&#39;, load_options=load_options)\n\nrather than:\nb = angr.Project(&#39;/bin/true&#39;, load_options)\n\nWhy are some ARM addresses off-by-one?\nIn order to encode THUMB-ness of an ARM code address, we set the lowest bit to one.\nThis convention comes from LibVEX, and is not entirely our choice!\nIf you see an odd ARM address, that just means the code at address - 1 is in THUMB mode.\nI get an exception that says AttributeError: &#39;FFI&#39; object has no attribute &#39;unpack&#39; What do I do?\nYou have an outdated version of the cffi Python module.  angr now requires at least version 1.7 of cffi.\nTry pip install --upgrade cffi.  If the problem persists, make sure your operating system hasn&#39;t pre-installed an old version of cffi, which pip may refuse to uninstall.\nIf you&#39;re using a Python virtual environment with the pypy interpreter, ensure you have a recent version of pypy, as it includes a version of cffi which pip will not upgrade.\n"},"docs/gotchas.html":{"url":"docs/gotchas.html","title":"問題点","body":"Gotchas when using angr\nThis section contains a list of gotchas that users/victims of angr frequently run into.\nSimProcedure inaccuracy\nTo make symbolic execution more tractable, angr replaces common library functions with summaries written in Python.\nWe call these summaries SimProcedures.\nSimProcedures allow us to mitigate path explosion that would otherwise be introduced by, for example, strlen running on a symbolic string.\nUnfortunately, our SimProcedures are far from perfect.\nIf angr is displaying unexpected behavior, it might be caused by a buggy/incomplete SimProcedure.\nThere are several things that you can do:\n\nDisable the SimProcedure (you can exclude specific SimProcedures by passing options to the angr.Project class). This has the drawback of likely leading to a path explosion, unless you are very careful about constraining the input to the function in question. The path explosion can be partially mitigated with other angr capabilities (such as Veritesting).\nReplace the SimProcedure with something written directly to the situation in question. For example, our scanf implementation is not complete, but if you just need to support a single, known format string, you can write a hook to do exactly that.\nFix the SimProcedure.\n\nUnsupported syscalls\nSystem calls are also implemented as SimProcedures.\nUnfortunately, there are system calls that we have not yet implemented in angr.\nThere are several workarounds for an unsupported system call:\n\nImplement the system call. TODO: document this process\nHook the callsite of the system call (using project.hook) to make the required modifications to the state in an ad-hoc way.\nUse the state.posix.queued_syscall_returns list to queue syscall return values. If a return value is queued, the system call will not be executed, and the value will be used instead. Furthermore, a function can be queued instead as the &quot;return value&quot;, which will result in that function being applied to the state when the system call is triggered.\n\nSymbolic memory model\nThe default memory model used by angr is inspired by Mayhem.\nThis memory model supports limited symbolic reads and writes.\nIf the memory index of a read is symbolic and the range of possible values of this index is too wide, the index is concretized to a single value.\nIf the memory index of a write is symbolic at all, the index is concretized to a single value.\nThis is configurable by changing the memory concretization strategies of state.memory.\nSymbolic lengths\nSimProcedures, and especially system calls such as read() and write() might run into a situation where the length of a buffer is symbolic.\nIn general, this is handled very poorly: in many cases, this length will end up being concretized outright or retroactively concretized in later steps of execution.\nEven in cases when it is not, the source or destination file might end up looking a bit &quot;weird&quot;.\n"},"CHANGELOG.html":{"url":"CHANGELOG.html","title":"更新履歴","body":"Changelog\nThis lists the major changes in angr.\nTracking minor changes are left as an exercise for the reader :-)\nangr 5.6.8.22\nMajor point release! An incredible number of things have changed in the month run-up to the Cyber Grand Challenge.\n\nIntegration with Unicorn Engine supported for concrete execution.\nA new SimRun type, SimUnicorn, may step through many basic blocks at once, so long as there is no operation on symbolic data.\nPlease use our fork of unicorn engine, which has many patches applied.\nAll these patches are pending merge into upstream.\nLots of improvements and bug fixes to CFGFast.\nRumors are angr’s CFG was only &quot;optimized&quot; for x86-64 binaries (which is really because most of our test cases are compiled as 64-bit ELFs).\nNow it is also “optimized” for x86 binaries :)\n(editor&#39;s note: angr is built with cross-architecture analysis in mind. CFG construction is pretty much the only component which has architecture-specific behavior.)\nLots of improvements to the VFG analysis, including speed and accuracy. However, there is still a lot to be done.\nLots of speed optimizations in general - CFGFast should be 3-6x faster under CPython with much less memory usage.\nNow data dependence graph gives you a real dependence graph between variable definitions. Try data_graph and simplified_data_graph on a DDG object!\nNew state option simuvex.o.STRICT_PAGE_ACCESS will cause a SimSegfaultError to be raised whenever the guest reads/writes/executes memory that is either unmapped or doesn&#39;t have the appropriate permissions.\nMerging of paths (as opposed to states) is performed in a much smarter way.\nThe behavior of the support_selfmodifying_code project option is changed:\nBefore, this would allow the state to be used as a fallback source of instruction bytes when no backer from CLE is available.\nNow, this option makes instruction lifting use the state as the source of bytes always.\nWhen the option is disabled and execution jumps outside the normal binary, the state will be used automatically.\nActually support self-modifying code - if a basic block of code modifies itself, the block will be re-lifted before the next instruction starts.\nSyscalls are handled differently now - Before you would see a SimRun for a syscall helper, now you&#39;ll just see a SimProcedure for the given syscall.\nAdditionally, each syscall has its own address in a &quot;syscalls segment&quot;, and syscalls are treated as jumps to this segment.\nThis simplifies a lot of things analysis-wise.\nCFGAccurate accepts a base_graph keyword to its constructor, e.g. CFGFast().graph, or even .graph of a function, to use as a base for analysis.\nNew fast memory model for cases where symbolic-addressed reads and writes are unlikely.\nConflicts between the find and avoid parameters to the Explorer otiegnqwvk are resolved correctly. (credit clslgrnc)\nNew analysis StaticHooker which hooks library functions in unstripped statically linked binaries.\nLifter can be used without creating an angr Project.\nYou must manually specify the architecture and bytestring in calls to .lift() and .fresh_block().\nIf you like, you can also specify the architecture as a parameter to the constructor and omit it from the lifting calls.\nAdd two new analyses developed for the CGC (mostly as examples of doing static analysis with angr): Reassembler and BinaryOptimizer.\n\nangr 4.6.6.28\nIn general, there have been enormous amounts of speed improvements in this release.\nDepending on the workload, angr should run about twice as fast.\nAside from this, there have also been many submodule-specific changes:\nangr\nQuite a few changes and improvements are made to CFGFast and CFGAccurate in order to have better and faster CFG recovery.\nThe two biggest changes in CFGFast are jump table resolution and data references collection, respectively.\nNow CFGFast resolves indirect jumps by default.\nYou may get a list of indirect jumps recovered in CFGFast by accessing the indirect_jumps attribute.\nFor many cases, it resolves the jump table accurately.\nData references collection is still in alpha mode.\nTo test data references collection, just pass collect_data_references=True when creating a fast CFG, and access the memory_data attribute after the CFG is constructed.\nCFG recovery on ARM binaries is also improved.\nA new paradigm called an &quot;otiegnqwvk&quot;, or an &quot;exploration technique&quot;, allows the packaging of special logic related to path group stepping.\nSimuVEX\nReads/writes to the x87 fpu registers now work correctly - there is special logic that rotates a pointer into part of the register file to simulate the x87 stack.\nWith the recent changes to Claripy, we have configured SimuVEX to use the composite solver by default.\nThis should be transparent, but should be considered if strange issues (or differences in behavior) arise during symbolic execution.\nClaripy\nFixed a bug in claripy where __div__ was not always doing unsigned division, and added new methods SDiv and SMod for signed division and signed remainder, respectively.\nClaripy frontends have been completely rewritten into a mixin-centric solver design. Basic frontend functionality (i.e., calling into the solver or dealing with backends) is handled by frontends (in claripy.frontends), and additional functionality (such as caching, deciding when to simplify, etc) is handled by frontend mixins (in claripy.frontend_mixins). This makes it considerably easier to customize solvers to your specific needE. For examples, look at claripy/solver.py.\nAlongside the solver rewrite, the composite solver (which splits constraints into independent constraint sets for faster solving) has been immensely improved and is now functional and fast.\nangr 4.6.6.4\nSyscalls are no longer handled by simuvex.procedures.syscalls.handler.\nInstead, syscalls are now handled by angr.SimOS.handle_syscall().\nPreviously, the address of a syscall SimProcedure is the address right after the syscall instruction (e.g. int 80h), which collides with the real basic block starting at that address, and is very confusing.\nNow each syscall SimProcedure has its own address, just as a normal SimProcedure.\nTo support this, there is another region mapped for the syscall addresses, Project._syscall_obj.\nSome refactoring and bug fixes in CFGFast.\nClaripy has been given the ability to handle annotations on ASTs.\nAn annotation can be used to customize the behavior of some backends without impacting others.\nFor more information, check the docstrings of claripy.Annotation and claripy.Backend.apply_annotation.\nangr 4.6.5.25\nNew state constructor - call_state. Comes with a refactor to SimCC, a refactor to callable, and the removal of PathGroup.call.\nAll these changes are thoroughly documented, in angr-doc/docs/structured_data.md\nRefactor of SimType to make it easier to use types - they can be instanciated without a SimState and one can be added later.\nComes with some usability improvements to SimMemView.\nAlso, there&#39;s a better wrapper around PyCParser for generating SimType instances from c declarations and definitions.\nAgain, thoroughly documented, still in the structured data doc.\nCFG is now an alias to CFGFast instead of CFGAccurate.\nIn general, CFGFast should work under most cases, and it&#39;s way faster than CFGAccurate.\nWe believe such a change is necessary, and will make angr more approachable to new users.\nYou will have to change your code from CFG to CFGAccurate if you are relying on specific functionalities that only exist in CFGAccurate, for example, context-sensitivity and state-preserving.\nAn exception will be raised by angr if any parameter passed to CFG is only supported by CFGAccurate.\nFor more detailed explanation, please take a look at the documentation of angr.analyses.CFG.\nangr 4.6.3.28\nPyVEX has a structural overhaul. The IRExpr, IRStmt, and IRConst modules no longer exist as submodules, and those module names are deprecated.\nUse pyvex.expr, pyvex.stmt, and pyvex.const if you need to access the members of those modules.\nThe names of the first three parameters to pyvex.IRSB (the required ones) have been changed.\nIf you were passing the positional args to IRSB as keyword args, consider switching to positional args.\nThe order is data, mem_addr, arch.\nThe optional parameter sargc to the entry_state and full_init_state constructors has been removed and replaced with an argc parameter.\nsargc predates being able to have claripy ASTs independent from a solver.\nThe new system is to pass in the exact value, ast or integer, that you&#39;d like to have as the guest program&#39;s arg count.\nCLE and angr can now accept file-like streams, that is, objects that support stream.read() and stream.seek() can be passed in wherever a filepath is expected.\nDocumentation is much more complete, especially for PyVEX and angr&#39;s symbolic execution control components.\nangr 4.6.3.15\nThere have been several improvements to claripy that should be transparent to users:\n\nThere&#39;s been a refactoring of the VSA StridedInterval classes to fix cases where operations were not sound. Precision might suffer as a result, however.\nSome general speed improvements.\nWe&#39;ve introduced a new backend into claripy: the ReplacementBackend. This frontend generates replacement sets from constraints added to it, and uses these replacement sets to increase the precision of VSA. Additionally, we have introduced the HybridBackend, which combines this functionality with a constraint solver, allowing for memory index resolution using VSA.\n\nangr itself has undergone some improvements, with API changes as a result:\n\nWe are moving toward a new way to store information that angr has recovered about a program: the knowledge base. When an analysis recovers some truth about a program (i.e., &quot;there&#39;s a basic block at 0x400400&quot;, or &quot;the block at 0x400400 has a jump to 0x400500&quot;), it gets stored in a knowledge-base. Analysis that used to store data (currently, the CFG) now store them in a knowledge base and can share the global knowledge base of the project, now accessible via project.kb. Over time, this knowledge base will be expanded in the course of any analysis or symbolic execution, so angr is constantly learning more information about the program it is analyzing.\nA forward data-flow analysis framework (called ForwardAnalysis) has been introduced, and the CFG was rewritten on top of it. The framework is still in alpha stage - expect more changes to be made. Documentation and more details will arrive shortly. The goal is to refactor other data-flow analysis, like CFGFast, VFG, DDG, etc. to use ForwardAnalysis.\nWe refactored the CFG to a) improve code readability, and b) eliminate some bad designs that linger due to historical reasons.\n\nangr 4.5.12.?\nClaripy has a new manager for backends, allowing external backends (i.e., those implemented by other modules) to be used.\nThe result is that claripy.backend_concrete is now claripy.backends.concrete, claripy.backend_vsa is now claripy.backends.vsa, and so on.\nangr 4.5.12.12\nImproved the ability to recover from failures in instruction decoding.\nYou can now hook specific addresses at which VEX fails to decode with project.hook, even if those addresses are not the beginning of a basic block.\nangr 4.5.11.23\nThis is a pretty beefy release, with over half of claripy having been rewritten and major changes to other analyses.\nInternally, Claripy has been unified -- the VSA mode and symbolic mode now work on the same structures instead of requiring structures to be created differently.\nThis opens the door for awesome capabilities in the future, but could also result in unexpected behavior if we failed to account for something.\nClaripy has had some major interface changes:\n\nclaripy.BV has been renamed to claripy.BVS (bit-vector symbol). It can now create bitvectors out of strings (i.e., claripy.BVS(0x41, 8) and claripy.BVS(&quot;A&quot;) are identical).\nstate.BV and state.BVV are deprecated. Please use state.se.BVS and state.se.BVV.\nBV.model is deprecated. If you&#39;re using it, you&#39;re doing something wrong, anyways. If you really need a specific model, convert it with the appropriate backend (i.e., claripy.backend_concrete.convert(bv)).\n\nThere have also been some changes to analyses:\n\nInterface: CFG argument keep_input_state has been renamed to keep_state. With this option enabled, both input and final states are kept.\nInterface: Two arguments cfg_node and stmt_id of BackwardSlicing have been deprecated. Instead, BackwardSlicing takes a single argument, targets. This means that we now support slicing from multiple sources.\nPerformance: The speed of CFG recovery has been slightly improved. There is a noticeable speed improvement on MIPS binaries.\nSeveral bugs have been fixed in DDG, and some sanity checks were added to make it more usable.\n\nAnd some general changes to angr itself:\n\nStringSpec is deprecated! You can now pass claripy bitvectors directly as arguments.\n\n"}}}
